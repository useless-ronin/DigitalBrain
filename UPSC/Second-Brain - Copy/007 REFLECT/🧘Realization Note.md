# KEEP THESE ON THE TOP OF YOUR MIND
 ###### Whenever you feel scared, jump in
 ###### If something gives comfort in the moment, don't do it. DO HARD THINGS.
  The outcome of inaction is pain and regret only

 >  Every minute you spend on planning is 10 minutes you save on execution
# Get Over the Feeling of Being Embarrased
 No one likes to be embarassed. Once you get over the fear of being embarassed, it allows you to go into the lanes that you wouldn't otherwise go into. It's hard to rewire someone.
# Balance Your Consumption Vs Production
  The amount of hours you put in consumption should never be equal or more than the time you spend creating or producing something
# You Just Want to Change How You Feel
  No, you don't want to binge watch netflix and be on your phone scrolling on social media 24/7. You just use that medium to escape from the reality and change how you feel. 
  You can do that in a better way. No, you don't have to go for your phone. You can do some pushups, run, stretch, practice productive procrastination, etc.
# Your Mind Has to Be Stronger Than Your Feelings
 There are always two voices in your head. Those two voices are coming from your mind and your feelings. Your mind has to be stronger than your feelings. Feelings keep you in bed. Your mind tells you to wake up.
 
 Disciple is what makes you or breaks you. You have to learn to be disciplined. Self-discipline. Only the disciplined are free in life. If you are not disciplined in life, you are a slave. You are a slave to your feelings. You are slave to your moods. You are a slave to your moods

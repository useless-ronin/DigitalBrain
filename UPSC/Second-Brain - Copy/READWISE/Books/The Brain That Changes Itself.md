## Highlights
- All the names of people who have undergone neuroplastic transformations are real
- Without operations or medications, they have made use of the brainâ€™s hitherto unknown ability to change
- For four hundred years this venture would have been inconceivable because mainstream medicine and science believed that brain anatomy was fixed
- The common wisdom was that after childhood the brain changed only when it began the long process of decline; that when brain cells failed to develop properly, or were injured, or died, they could not be replaced.

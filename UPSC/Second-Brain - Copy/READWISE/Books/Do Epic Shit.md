Thoughts that we all feel, repeatedly, but rarely stop to make sense of. ([6](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=6)) ^262801451

---

This book is not going to change your life. It is meant to make you more aware. So that you make choices in life from a state of awareness and not ignorance ([7](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=7)) ^262801452

Every day, open a random page. Read one, maybe three pages. Reflect upon them. Maybe make some notes. Or just smile at how it made you feel. ([8](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=8)) ^262801559

Nothing beats the feeling of having done more in twenty-four hours than what the day expected you to! ([11](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=11)) ^262801722

---

No one sees how you overcame your habits and systems despite having ‘failed’, because they focus on the end result, that you failed. ([12](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=12)) ^263082587

---

What you become during the process of success and failure is what’s most important. ([13](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=13)) ^263082588

---

If you worry that people won’t like your decisions, you will make decisions that would please them. ([14](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=14)) ^263082658

3 relationships that define almost everything that happens to us in
our lives.
• The relationship we have with money.
• The relationship we have with time.
• The relationship we have with ourselves. ([15](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=15)) ^263082665

consider
doing it!
Fighting the stereotype is a great way to get attention! ([16](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=16)) ^263082724

---

There is temporary discomfort in doing the unconventional.
There is permanent discomfort in living life as a template. ([18](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=18)) ^263083397

---

Your goal is to make people say: ‘I am not sure if she knows how to do it. But I am certain if told to do it, she will definitely figure it out. I trust her. ([19](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=19)) ^263084258

---

Mistakes I made in my 20s ([20](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=20)) ^263084262

---

Just because you are good at something doesn’t automatically ensure you are happy doing it. ([21](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=21)) ^263084272

---

It is not what you do but who you are underneath that defines you. ([22](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=22)) ^263084300

I read books that made me look cool.

---

They want to be led. Not managed. ([28](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=28)) ^263087489

---

I thought that no one wants to be led. Everyone wants to do their own thing, so let them.
Not true. ([29](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=29)) ^263087712

---

Hope is not a strategy ([30](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=30)) ^263090471

---

As the decade passed, I realized what is truly important in life.
It wasn’t money for me, or fame or recognition.
It was the ability to do what I wanted to, without caring about what the world thinks of me. ([31](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=31)) ^263091096

Do not allow comfort to make you believe that you no longer need to try! ([37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=37)) ^263101417

Comfort is a destination.
Trying more is a path. ([38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=38)) ^263101418

We are just scared to make those choices. ([78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=null&location=78)) ^263131411

## Highlights
- Once you **understand the power and peril of dopamine, you’ll better understand the human condition itself**.”
- epic saga of dopamine as a page-turner that you simply can’t put down.”
- have created a road map for all those wrestling between insatiable longing and the here and now.”
- **“Why do we crave what we don’t have rather than feel good about what we do—and why do fools fall in love? Haunting questions of human biology are answered by The Molecule of More, a must-read about the human condition.”**
- “Jim Watson, who deciphered the genetic code, famously said, **‘There are only molecules; the rest is sociology**,’
- the molecule that allows us to bridge the chasm between them is dopamine.

- To reach them, you have to plan, think, calculate. Even if it’s only a little, it still requires some coordinated effort. Unlike what we see when we look down, the realm of up shows us things that we have to think about and work for in order to get.
- In your brain the down world is managed by a handful of chemicals—neurotransmitters, they’re called—that let you experience satisfaction and enjoy whatever you have in the here and now.
- It drives you to seek out those things far away, both physical things and things you cannot see, such as knowledge, love, and power.
- this chemical gives us command over every distance, whether geographical or intellectual.
- down chemicals—call them the Here & Nows—allow you to experience what’s in front of you. They enable you to savor and enjoy, or perhaps to fight or run away, right now
- The up chemical is different. It makes you desire what you don’t yet have, and drives you to seek new things. It rewards you when you obey it, and makes you suffer when you don’t.
- **it is the key to addiction and the path to recovery;**
- makes successful actors and entrepreneurs and artists keep working long after they have all the money and fame they ever dreamed of; and that makes a satisfied husband or wife risk everything for the thrill of someone else.
- **It is the source of the undeniable itch that drives scientists to find explanations and philosophers to find order, reason, and meaning.**
- It is fuel for the motor of our dreams; it is the source of our despair when we fail.
- It is why we seek and succeed; it is why we discover and prosper.
  It is also why we are never happy for very long.
- Mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish all have this chemical inside their brains, but no creature has more of it than a human being.
- It is a blessing and a curse, a motivation and a reward
- This is dopamine, and it narrates no less than the story of human behavior.
- **The brain is so complex that even the most sophisticated neuroscientist must simplify to build a model of the brain that’s capable of being understood.**
- science is messy. Sometimes studies contradict one another, and it takes time to sort out which results are correct.
- Science is not only messy; it can sometimes be bizarre
- Love is a need, a craving, a drive to seek life’s greatest prize.
- we explore the chemicals that make you want sex and fall in love—and why, sooner or later, everything changes.
- Lots of factors pushed them along to what would become a long-term relationship: their common interests, the ease they felt with each other, even the drinks and a little desperation
- But none of that was the real key to love. The big factor was this: they were both under the influence of a mind-altering chemical. So was everyone else in the bar.
  And, it turns out, so are you.
- dopamine was seen simply as a way for the body to produce a chemical called norepinephrine, which is what adrenaline is called when it is found in the brain.
- Only 0.0005 percent of brain cells produce dopamine—one in two million—yet these cells appeared to exert an outsized influence on behavior.
- The reputation of dopamine as the pleasure molecule was further cemented through experiments with drug addicts.
- They reasoned that it’s unlikely that dopamine pathways evolved to encourage people to get high on drugs. Drugs were probably causing an artificial form of dopamine stimulation.
- the evolutionary processes that harnessed dopamine were driven by the need to motivate survival and reproductive activity
- **Dopamine, they discovered, isn’t about pleasure at all. Dopamine delivers a feeling much more influential.**
- **Understanding dopamine turns out to be the key to explaining and even predicting behavior across a spectacular range of human endeavors**: creating art, literature, and music; seeking success; discovering new worlds and new laws of nature; thinking about God—and falling in love.
- Shawn wanted to be sure they would be together forever, so one day he proposed to her. She said yes.
- A few months after their honeymoon, things began to change. At the start they had been obsessed with one another, but, with the passage of time, that desperate longing became less desperate.
- They weren’t unhappy, but the profound satisfaction from their earlier time together was slipping away
- Thoughts about each other, that used to come constantly, didn’t. Other women began to draw Shawn’s attention, not that he intended to cheat. Samantha let herself flirt sometimes, too, even if it was no more than a shared smile with the college boy bagging groceries in the checkout line.
- **MONKEYS AND RATS AND WHY LOVE FADES**
- rats are easier to study than human beings.
- **Natural rewards stimulate dopamine activity just as well as cocaine and other drugs**.
- Why would dopamine stop firing when stimulation keeps coming? The answer came from an unlikely source: a monkey and a light bulb.
- It took the monkeys some time to figure out the rule. At first they opened the boxes randomly, and got it right about half the time. When they found a food pellet, the dopamine cells in their brain fired, just as in the rats. After a while, the monkeys figured out the signals and reached for the correct, food-containing box every time—and at that, the timing of the dopamine release began to change from firing at the discovery of the food to firing at the light. Why?
- once the monkeys figured out that the light meant they were about to get food, the “surprise” they felt came exclusively from the appearance of the light, not from the food.
- dopamine activity is not a marker of pleasure. It is a reaction to the unexpected—to possibility and anticipation.
- As human beings, we get a dopamine rush from similar, promising surprises
- But when these things become regular events, their novelty fades, and so does the dopamine rush—and a sweeter note or a longer email or a better table won’t bring it back.
- Our brains are programmed to crave the unexpected and thus to look to the future, where every exciting possibility begins.
- But when anything, including love, becomes familiar, that excitement slips away, and new things draw our attention.
- We constantly make predictions about what’s coming next, from what time we can leave work, to how much money we expect to find when we check our balance at the ATM
- That happy error is what launches dopamine into action.
- When what happens is better than what we expect, it is literally an error in our forecast of the future:
- It’s the thrill of the unexpected good news.
- It’s the pleasure of anticipation—the possibility of something unfamiliar and better.
- sometimes when we get the things we want, it’s not as pleasant as we expect. Dopaminergic excitement (that is, the thrill of anticipation) doesn’t last forever, because eventually the future becomes the present.
- after a few weeks, “the best coffee and croissant in the city” became the same old breakfast.
- But it wasn’t the coffee and the croissant that changed; it was your expectation
- When things become part of the daily routine, there is no more reward prediction error, and dopamine is no longer triggered to give you those feelings of excitement.

- Women actors are exploited sexually and men are pressured to take steroids and growth hormone to get the fabulous bodies we see on screen.
- Those with higher levels of dopamine want to climb it, explore it, conquer it. But they can’t, because it doesn’t exist. The mountain itself exists. But the imagined experience of being on it is impossible to achieve.
- The reality is that most of the time you’re on a mountain you can’t even tell. Typically you’re surrounded by trees, and that’s all you see
- Glamour creates desires that cannot be fulfilled because they are desires for things that exist only in the imagination.
- only things that are out of reach can be glamorous; only things that are unreal. Glamour is a lie.
- She found him as funny and smart as ever, and in great shape, too. In minutes she was starry-eyed again.
- He was excited, too, and anxious to share his feelings
- That feeling with Demarco was what she wanted. She had once had it with Shawn, but not anymore
- THE DARK SIDE
- There’s a dark side to dopamine
- If you drop a pellet of food into a rat’s cage, the animal will experience a dopamine surge.
- But if you keep dropping pellets every 5 minutes, dopamine stops
- so there’s no surprise, and there is no error in the rat’s prediction of a reward.
- One of the world’s largest manufacturers of slot machines is owned by a company called Scientific Games. Science plays a big role in the design of these compelling devices
- Every reward was unexpected. The birds became excited. They pecked faster. Something was spurring them on to greater efforts.
- Dopamine, the molecule of surprise, had been harnessed, and the scientific foundation of the slot machine was born.
- Demarco’s appearance, and the half-conscious dream of another chance at passionate excitement, was an unexpected treat dropped into her emotional life, and that surprise was the source of her excitement. Samantha, of course, didn’t know that
- with an understanding of the role of dopamine, it’s clear that this relationship is not something new. It’s just another repetition of dopamine-driven excitement.
- We can transition to a love that’s fed by a day-to-day appreciation of that other person in the here and now, or we can end the relationship and go in search of another roller coaster ride
- Early love is a ride on a merry-go-round that sits at the foot of a bridge. That carousel can take you around and around on a beautiful trip as many times as you like, but it will always leave you where you began
- dopamine is steering things in your life, at least when it comes to sex
- It’s pursuit, which is driven by dopamine, the molecule that cultivates perpetual dissatisfaction
- He imagined each new woman as a potential life mate, the perfect female who would go with him into happily ever after.
- addicted to the dopamine thrill of chasing romance that he spent an entire season trying to extract himself from his engagement to the only woman who continued to love him despite every awful thing he did.
- We revel in the passion, the focus, the excitement, the thrill of finding new love.
- The difference is that most of us figure out at some point that dopamine lies to us.
- we come to understand that the next beautiful woman or a handsome man we see is probably not the key to “satisfaction
- “Why can’t you enjoy the things you have?”
- From dopamine’s point of view, having things is uninteresting.
- It’s only getting things that matters.
- If you live in a tent, dopamine makes you want a house. If you live in the most expensive mansion in the world, dopamine makes you want a castle on the moon.
- The dopamine circuits in the brain can be stimulated only by the possibility of whatever is shiny and new, never mind how perfect things are at the moment. The dopamine motto is “More.”
- Dopamine isn’t the pleasure molecule, after all. It’s the anticipation molecule
- Most people have heard of the H&Ns. They include serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins (your brain’s version of morphine), and a class of chemicals called endocannabinoids (your brain’s version of marijuana).
- one of the endocannabinoid molecules is called anandamide, named after a Sanskrit word that means joy, bliss, and delight.
- for a couple to remain attached to one another, they need to develop a different sort of love called companionate love.
- Companionate love is mediated by the H&Ns because it involves experiences that are happening right here, right now—you’re with the one you love, so enjoy it.
- Their behavior is characterized by cooperative territory defense and nest building
- dopamine paints a picture in our minds of a rosy future in order to spur us on through the hard work necessary to make it a reality.
- Dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs is an important ingredient in bringing about change, which is what a new relationship is all about
- When H&N circuits are activated, we are prompted to experience the real world around us, and dopamine is suppressed; when dopamine circuits are activated, we move into a future of possibilities, and H&Ns are suppressed
- It’s not easy to say farewell to the dopaminergic thrill of new partners and passionate longing, but the ability to do so is a sign of maturity, and a step toward long-lasting happiness.
- He’s not ungrateful to see the masterpieces of Michelangelo. It’s just that his personality is primarily dopaminergic: he enjoys anticipation and planning more than doing.
- Lovers experience the same disconnect between anticipation and experience.
- A romance built on dopamine is a thrilling, if short-lived, roller coaster ride, but our brain chemistry gives us the tools to move down the path that leads to companionate love
- Just as dopamine is the molecule of obsessive yearning, the chemicals most associated with long-term relationships are oxytocin and vasopressin.
- Oxytocin is more active in women and vasopressin in men
- Vasopressin acted like a “good-husband hormone.” Dopamine does the opposit
- Human beings who have genes that produce high levels of dopamine have the highest number of sexual partners and the lowest age of first sexual intercourse.
- oxytocin and vasopressin suppress the release of testosterone
- In a similar way, testosterone suppresses the release of oxytocin and vasopressin
- which helps explain why men with naturally high quantities of testosterone in their blood are less likely to marry
- Do human beings require long-term companionship? There’s good evidence that the answer is yes
- Despite the superficial appeal of having multiple partners, most people eventually settle down
- We can live without companionate love, but the majority of us arrange a good portion of our lives around trying to find it and keep it.
- The H&Ns give us the ability to do that. They allow us to find satisfaction in what our senses deliver—what is right in front of us, and what we can experience without the nagging sense that we need something more
- Testosterone drives sexual desire in both men and women
- Men produce large amounts—it’s responsible for aspects of masculinity such as facial hair, increased muscle mass, and a low-pitched voice.
- On average, women have the highest levels of testosterone on days thirteen and fourteen of their menstrual cycle.
- When scientists at Procter & Gamble (the maker of Old Spice cologne and Pampers diapers) applied a testosterone gel to women’s skin, the women had more sex. Unfortunately, some of the women developed facial hair, low-pitched voices, and male pattern baldness, so the “female Viagra” gel never received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United States.
- When one is hungry, all kinds of different foods will satisfy the urge to eat. Similarly, when a person experiences testosterone-induced sexual urges, the desire is for sex in general, not necessarily for a particular person.
- **DOPAMINE GETS YOU INTO BED . . . AND THEN GETS IN THE WAY**
- From eager anticipation to the physical pleasures of intimacy, the stages of sex recapitulate the stages of love
- **sex is love on fast forward.**
- **Sex begins with desire, a dopaminergic phenomenon driven by the hormone testosterone.**
- It continues with arousal, another forward-looking, dopaminergic experience
- **As physical contact begins, the brain shifts control to the H&Ns to deliver the pleasure of the sensory experience, mainly with the release of endorphins**
- The consummation of the act, orgasm, is almost entirely a here-and-now experience, with endorphins and other H&N neurotransmitters working together to shut down dopamine.
- **The scans showed that sexual climax was associated with decreased activation throughout the prefrontal cortex, a dopaminergic part of the brain responsible for placing deliberate restrictions on behavior**
- With few exceptions the brain’s response to orgasm was the same: dopamine off, H&N on.
- people have difficulty moving from passionate love to companionate love, it can be also be difficult for dopamine-driven people to let the H&Ns take over during sex.
- While H&N neurotransmitters let us experience reality—and reality during sex is intense—dopamine floats above reality.
- To add to its seduction, it puts us in control of that alternate reality.
- That these imagined worlds may be impossible doesn’t matter. Dopamine can always send us chasing phantoms.
- survey of 141 women found that 65 percent of them daydreamed during intercourse about being with another person or even doing something completely different. Other studies have put the figure as high as 92 percent.
- Men daydream during sex about as much as women, and the more sex both men and women have, the more likely they are to daydream
- It is ironic that brain circuits that give us the energy and motivation we need to get ourselves into bed with a desirable partner subsequently get in the way of our enjoying the fun.
- Sex for the first time is more intense than sex for the hundredth time—especially sex for the hundredth time with the same partner.
- ￼   WHY MOM WANTS YOU TO WAIT   ￼
  UNTIL YOU’RE MARRIED
- there are still a lot of mothers (and anxious fathers) who encourage their daughters to “save themselves for marriage.”
- Testosterone and dopamine have a special relationship
- Passionate love usually increases the desire to have sex.
- denying sexual satisfaction actually enhances passion—not necessarily forever, of course, and not without significant sacrifice, but the effect is real.
- Waiting prolongs the most exciting phase of love.
- Dopamine tends to shut down once fantasy becomes reality, and dopamine is the driving chemical of romantic love.
- Dopamine got the nickname “the pleasure molecule” based on experiments with addictive drugs
- The drugs lit up dopamine circuits and test participants experienced euphoria.
- only unexpected rewards triggered dopamine release
- Dopamine responded not to reward, but to reward prediction error:
- the actual reward minus the expected reward.
- When we fall in love, we look to a future made perfect by the presence of our beloved. It’s a future built on a fevered imagination that falls to pieces when reality reasserts itself twelve to eighteen months later. Then what? In many cases it’s over.
- It can become companionate love, which may not thrill the way dopamine does, but has the power to deliver happiness—long-term happiness based on H&N neurotransmitters such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and endorphin.
- **Dopamine, the neurotransmitter whose purpose is to maximize future rewards, starts us down the road to love.**
- when it comes to love, dopamine is a place to begin, not to finish. It can never be satisfied. Dopamine can only say, “More.”

- In which dopamine overwhelms reason to create consuming desire for the most destructive behaviors imaginable
- A guy walks past a restaurant, smells burgers cooking. He imagines taking a bite; he can almost taste it. He’s on a diet, but at this point he can’t think of anything he wants more than that hamburger, so he goes in and orders one.
- the first bite is wonderful, but the second bite, not so much. With each bite, his enjoyment is less and less—so much for the hoped-for “hamburger heaven.
- He finishes anyway, not really knowing why, then feels a little nauseated and very much defeated because he didn’t stick to his diet.
- there’s a big difference between wanting something and liking it.
- WHO’S IN CONTROL OF YOUR BRAIN?
- At some point, everyone asks the question, why? Why do I do the things that I do? Why do I make the choices that I make?
- The philosopher Aristotle played this same game, but with a more serious purpose
- **Why do you go to work, really? Why do you need to make money? Why do you have to pay bills? Why do you want the electricity to stay on? Where does it end? Is there anything we seek for itself only, not because it leads to something else?**
- Aristotle decided there was. He decided there was a single thing that lay at the end of every string of Whys, and its name was Happiness. Everything we do, ultimately, is for the sake of happiness.
- H**Why do you go to work, really? Why do you need to make money? Why do you have to pay bills? Why do you want the electricity to stay on? Where does it end? Is there anything we seek for itself only, not because it leads to something else?**
- **When faced with a range of options, we choose the one that leads to the most happiness.**
- Except we don’t.
- **Our brains aren’t wired that way**
- Only once in a while do we sit down to consider our options rationally, weighing one against the other.
- I**t’s much easier just to do what we want, so that’s what we do.**
- **what do we want?” The answer depends on whom you ask:**
- T**he answer depends on when you ask, too.**
- The 7:00 PM answer might be “dinner”; the 7:00 AM answer might be “another 10 minutes of sleep.”
- Sometimes people don’t know what they want at all; other times they want lots of things at once—things that they cannot have at the same time, because they conflict with one another.
- Most people, when they see a donut, want to eat it. Most people, when they see a donut, want to not eat it. What’s going on?
- **Wanting, or desire, flows from an evolutionarily old part of the brain deep inside the skull called the ventral tegmental area.**
- When these long-tailed cells are activated, they release dopamine into the nucleus accumbens, driving the feeling we know as motivation.
- **This dopamine circuit evolved to promote behaviors that lead to survival and reproduction,**
- to help us get food and sex, and to win competitions.
- s the desire circuit that’s activated when you see the plate of donuts on the table, and it’s activated not by need, but by the presence of something attractive from an evolutionary or life-sustaining standpoint.
- **the circuit is activated whether or not you’re hungry. That’s the nature of dopamine.**
- It’s always focused on acquiring more of everything with an eye toward providing for the future
- Hunger is something that happens here and now, in the present
- **But dopamine says, “Go ahead and eat the donut, even if you’re not hungry. It will increase your chance of staying alive in the future. Who knows when food will be available next?”**
- That made sense for our evolutionary ancestors, who lived most of their lives on the brink of starvation.
- **For a biological organism, the most important goal related to the future is to be alive when it comes**
- the dopamine system is more or less obsessed with keeping us alive
- e. **It constantly scans the environment for new sources of food, shelter, mating opportunities, and other resources that will keep our DNA replicating.**
- When it **finds something that’s potentially valuable, dopamine switches on, sending the message Wake up. Pay attention. This is important.**
- The sensation of wanting is not a choice you make. It is a reaction to the things you encounter.
- From now on, whenever she sees this bush, a little dopamine will be released to make her more alert and to give her a hint of excitement, the better to motivate her to acquire this thing that can help her stay alive.
- An important memory has been formed: important because it’s linked to survival, important because it was triggered by the release of dopamine.
- But what happens when dopamine gets out of control?
- dopamine is an early-warning system for the appearance of anything that can help us surviv
- When something useful to our continued existence appears, we don’t have to think about it. Dopamine makes us want it, right now. It doesn’t matter if we’re going to like it, or if we even need it at the moment.
- dopamine urges you to possess and accumulate anything that might help keep you alive.
- This explains why the man on the diet wanted that hamburger even though he wasn’t hungry.

## Highlights
- **Impulsive behavior occurs when too much value is placed on immediate pleasure and not enough on long-term consequences.**
- Many of the decisions that addicts make, particularly the harmful decisions, are impulsive
- Desire dopamine overpowers the more rational parts of the brain. We make choices that we know are not in our best interest, but we feel powerless to resist.
- It’s as if our free will has been compromised by an overwhelming urge for immediate pleasure
- When the addict stimulates his dopamine system, his dopamine system responds by demanding more stimulation.
- Nicotine, in fact, is an unusual drug because it does very little except trigger compulsive use
- **When you give people nicotine for the first time, most people don’t like it. It’s different from many other addictive drugs, for which most people say they enjoy the first experience and would try it again.”**
- **Some people say it makes them feel more relaxed or more alert, but really, the main thing it does is relieve cravings for itself.**
- The only point of smoking cigarettes is to get addicted so one can experience the pleasure of relieving the unpleasant feeling of craving, like a man who carries around a rock all day because it feels so good when he puts it down.
- Addiction arises from the chemical cultivation of desire
- A**ddiction is not a sign of weak character or a lack of willpower. It occurs when the desire circuits get thrown into a pathological state by overstimulation.**
- Prod dopamine too hard and too long, and its power comes roaring out. Once it has taken charge of a life, it is difficult to tame.
- Recreational drugs aren’t the only ones that stimulate dopamine. There are prescription drugs that do it as well, and when they hit the desire circuit too hard, strange things can happen.
- **When there is not enough dopamine in this circuit, people become stiff and shaky, and they move slowly**
- The treatment is to prescribe drugs that boost dopamine.
- The enhanced dopamine circuit boosted impulsive behavior, but not satisfaction—it boosted the wanting, but not the liking.
- It’s over a hundred times more likely that a person will be struck by lightning than win the lottery. Yet millions of people buy tickets. “Someone has to win,” they say
- In all, this man of modest means gambled away over $100,000. He was finally able to stop in 2010, when he read an article about the link between Parkinson’s medication and gambling. He stopped taking Cabaser, and the problem went away.
- People who gambled frequently in the past are more likely than others to experience out-of-control gambling after they start Parkinson’s medication, suggesting there are certain personality features that put people at risk.
- Yet another patient expressed his hypersexuality by spending hours every day in internet adult chat rooms—but even otherwise healthy people taking no medication at all are susceptible to the dopamine call of pornography, supercharged by the internet.
- Of course, you don’t need Parkinson’s medication coursing through your brain to have your life upended by sexual obsession. Consider the fearsome triad of dopamine, technology, and porn.
- **MORE, MORE, MORE: DOPAMINE AND THE POWER OF PORNOGRAPHY**
- bad. He was accessing the internet over a dial-up modem and “it took ages for the pictures to load.” He was lucky. Technology was limiting his daily dose
- He described the pictures he started with as “tame
- Over time, both of these would change. Broadband allowed him to access pictures instantly, and he could now add video to his daily routine
- Tame material gave way to depictions of more extreme acts as his tolerance for pornographic thrills increased.
- when his work assigned him to an overseas branch, everything fell apart. Unable to speak the local language, he became socially isolated, and his compulsion flared up worse than ever.
- He said, “What makes this so hard is the inner struggle, the conflict within. It’s a war against yourself.” Feeling completely out of control, he no longer believed it was a strictly moral failing. “I need to fight this on a chemical level because at some point I want to get married.”
- Thanks to the internet, sexually graphic material is more easily available than ever befor
- their dopamine circuits lit up. The circuits went back to normal when ordinary videos were displayed
- of all the content on the internet, pictures of undressed women were most likely to make young men click compulsively
- They also discovered that showing people “highly arousing sexual pictures” was distracting when they were trying to pay attention to something else
- compulsive sexual behavior was fueled by easy access to sexual images on the internet.
- **THE POWER OF EASY ACCESS**
- When it comes to addiction, easy access matters. More people get addicted to cigarettes and alcohol than to heroin, even though heroin hits the brain in a way that is more likely to trigger addiction.
- Cigarettes and alcohol are a larger public health problem because they are so easy to obtain
- We’ve all seen “quit smoking” advertisements on buses and subways. They don’t work. We’ve heard about school programs that teach kids to say no to drugs and alcohol.
- As barriers to the use of tobacco have gone up, barriers to pornography have gone down.
- Today, pornographic pictures and videos can be had in seconds and in complete privacy. There are no barriers of embarrassment or sham
- They abandon other activities so they can focus on adult internet sites. Sexual relations with their partners tend to become less frequent and less satisfying.
- One young man gave up dating completely. He said that he’d rather look at pornography than go out with a real woman because the women in the pictures never demanded anything of him, and never said no.
- As with drugs, habituation can also occur with pornography, in which the starting “dose” no longer works as well.
- It’s hard to resist the demands of dopamine circuits, especially with something as evolutionarily important as sex.
- **ARE VIDEO GAMES ADDICTIVE, TOO?**
- “Sex addicts showed higher levels of desire when watching pornography, but did not necessarily rate the explicit videos higher in their ‘liking’ scores.”
- Some scientists claim that video games can also be addicting.
- video games are similar to casino games.
- Like slot machines, video games surprise players with unpredictable rewards.
- nearly one in ten gamers ages eight to eighteen are addicted
- The biggest difference in the adolescent brain is in the frontal lobes, which don’t completely develop until their early twenties.
- That’s a problem because it’s the frontal lobes that give adults good judgment.
- They act like a brake, warning us when we’re about to do something that might not be such a good idea.
- Video games are more complex than slot machines, so there are more opportunities for programmers to bake in features that trigger dopamine release in order to make it hard to stop playing
- Gamers progress through levels while increasing their strength and abilities. It’s a dopamine dream come true.
- To keep progress front and center in a gamer’s mind, the screen constantly displays the accumulating points or growing progress bars so players never forget. They have to keep pursuing more.
- Players’ expectations are constantly kept off balance because they never know where the next reward will be.
- Online games are constantly collecting information about players. How long do they play? When do they quit?
- What kinds of experiences make them play longer? What kinds make them give up?
- game designers are not thinking of these events as dopamine triggers, but simply as “what works
- It turns out that 25 percent is the magic number. That’s what keeps people playing the longest. And there’s no reason why the other 75 percent should be empty
- Game developers put low-value rewards in the non-gem chests so every single one will contain a surprise.
- It’s worth mentioning that there are also H&N pleasures in video games that contribute to their appeal
- Many games let you play with friends. The pleasure we get when we socialize for no other reason than the enjoyment of the company of others is an H&N experience
- On the other hand, when we get together to accomplish a shared goal, it’s dopaminergic because we’re working toward a better future (even if it’s just capturing the enemy’s base).
- Many video games are also beautiful, another way of stimulating H&N delight
- The world of the game is vast. Working through all the story lines would require 1,600 hours of play.
- Grand Theft Auto, one of the most successful video game series, had sales of $1 billion in just three days for its fifth-generation release
- Americans spend more than $20 billion per year on video games; they spent only half that much on movie tickets in 2016, the biggest U.S. box office year in history
- **DOPAMINE VERSUS DOPAMINE**
- It’s natural to confuse wanting and liking.
- That’s how it would work if we were rational creatures, and despite all evidence to the contrary, we persist in thinking that we are rational creatures.
- Frequently we want things that we don’t like. Our desires can lead us toward things that may destroy our lives, such as drugs, gambling, and other out-of-control behaviors.
- The dopamine desire circuit is powerful. It focuses attention, motivates, and thrills. It has a profound influence over the choices we make.
- Yet it isn’t all-powerful
- What kind of circuit in the brain is powerful enough to oppose dopamine?
- Dopamine is.
- Dopamine opposing dopamine.
- The circuit that opposes the desire circuit might be called the dopamine control circuit.
- Why would the brain develop circuits that work against each other?
- Wouldn’t it make more sense to have everyone pulling together, so to speak?
- Systems that contain opposing forces are easier to control. That’s why cars have both an accelerator and a brake, and why the brain uses circuits that counter each other.
- the dopamine control circuit involves the frontal lobes, the part of the brain that is sometimes called the neocortex because it evolved most recently
- It’s what makes human beings unique
- **It gives us the imagination to project ourselves further into the future than the desire circuit can take us, so we can make long-term plans.**
- It’s intensely rational.
- **It doesn’t feel, because emotion is an H&N phenomenon**
- Impulse without reason is not enough, and reason without impulse is a poor makeshift.

- One cool judgment is worth a dozen hasty councils.

- when we do things without thinking about how and what next, failure is not even the worst possible outcome.
- Desire dopamine makes us want things. It is the source of raw desire: give me more.
- It gives us the ability to construct plans—to strategize and dominate the world around us to get the things we want. How does a single chemical do both things?
- The same fuel that pushes the rocket forward can be redirected to drive directional thrusters to steer the ship, as well as retrorockets to slow it down. It all depends on the path the fuel takes before it’s ignited—different functions, but all working together to get the spaceship to its destination.
- dopamine moving through different brain circuits yields different functions, too, and toward a common end: a relentless focus on enhancing the future
- Urges come from dopamine passing through the mesolimbic circuit, which we call the dopamine desire circuit
- In addition, the d**opamine control circuit is the source of imagination**
- both circuits give us the capacity to consider “phantoms”—things that don’t physically exist
- **Control dopamine carries us beyond the primitive I want of desire dopamine.** **It gives us tools to comprehend, analyze, and model the world around us, so we can extrapolate possibilities, compare and contrast them, then craft ways to achieve our goals**
- **desire dopamine is the kid in the back seat shouting for his parents to “Look! Look!” every time he sees a McDonald’s, a toy store, or a puppy on the sidewalk.**
- **Control dopamine is the parent at the wheel, hearing each request and considering whether it’s worth stopping for—and deciding what to do if he pulls over.**
- It’s fun figuring out things, and it’s fun carrying out the strategies developed to “game” the intricacies of car buying and the daily trip to work. Why? As always, the function of dopamine flows from the imperatives of evolution and survival.
- **Dopamine encourages us to maximize our resources by rewarding us when we do so—the act of doing something well, of making our future a better, safer place, gives us a little dopamine “buzz.”**
- I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.
- TENACITY
- **Success takes years of hard work and so many revisions to the original idea that it’s barely recognizable by the time it gets to market.**
- THE CASE OF THE RESOLUTE RATS
- Researchers from the University of Connecticut wanted to see if they could manipulate a rat’s tenacity by changing the activity of dopamine in its brain.
- The first experiment was easy. To receive a Bioserve treat, each rat had to press the lever only one time. Since essentially no work was needed—no tenacity required—this experiment established a necessary condition: it demonstrated that dopamine-deficient rats liked the treats as much as normal rats.
- **When no work was required, the dopamine-deprived rats pressed the lever as many times as the normal rats, and devoured the treats they had earned.**
- When the required number of lever presses was increased from one to four, the normal rats pressed their levers nearly a thousand times over the course of 30 minutes. **The dopamine-depleted rats weren’t as motivated; they pressed the lever only about six hundred times.**
- When the requirement was increased to sixteen presses, the normal rats produced nearly two thousand presses, while the dopamine-depleted rats barely increased their presses at all. **They were getting only one-quarter the number of treats, but they wouldn’t work harder.**
- Finally, the requirement was bumped all the way up to sixty-four presses for a single Bioserve tablet. The normal rats managed about twenty-five hundred presses—more than one press per second for the entire 30 minutes. **The dopamine-depleted rats didn’t increase their work at all. In fact, they pressed less than they had before. They simply gave up.**
- Removing dopamine appeared to diminish a rat’s will to work.
- How much ice cream you want has nothing to do with whether you’re hard-working or lazy.
- do with whether you’re hard-working or lazy. It’s just that food doesn’t mean as much when you’re not hungry. So the scientists added a new dimension to the experiment: they manipulated hunger.
- They didn’t slack off. They didn’t give up. They just didn’t want to eat as many pellets because they weren’t hungry
- The feeling of hunger (or the absence of hunger) changed how much the rats valued the pellets, but it did not diminish their willingness to work.
- Hunger is an H&N phenomenon, an immediate experience, not an anticipatory, dopamine-driven one.
- But it’s dopamine that makes the work possible at all: no dopamine, no effort
- how dopamine affects the choices we make between working hard or taking the easy way.

- They achieve something, then move on to the next thing.
- This problem can result in a familiar condition: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).2 Poor focus, concentration, and impulse control can severely interfere with their lives, and it can make them difficult to be with.
- Sometimes they don’t keep track of time, making them late, and they may lose things, such as car keys, cell phones, even passports.
- Kids with ADHD grab toys and cut in line. Adults with ADHD make impulse purchases and interrupt people.
- People who live with ADHD are at high risk of addiction, especially adolescents, because of their poorly functioning frontal lobes.
- On the other hand, if effective treatment is withheld, the weakness of the control circuit is not corrected. The desire circuit acts unopposed, increasing the likelihood of high-risk, pleasure-seeking behavior
- A SURPRISING RISK AMONG ADHD PATIENTS
- **children with ADHD were 40 percent more likely to be obese, and adults were 70 percent more likely to be obese**
- Children are constantly cued to eat by food commercials, vending machines, etc., so it is easy to imagine how a child who is poorly inhibited could have difficulty resisting these cues to eat.”
- **It’s important to remember that biology is not destiny**
- **I like to win, but more than anything, I can’t stand this idea of losing. Because to me, losing means death.**
  —Lance Armstrong
- “[A tree] was once on the other side of [his] property, 50 yards west of his house. Armstrong wanted it at the front steps. The transplantation cost $200,000. His close friends joke that Armstrong, who is agnostic, engineered the project to prove he didn’t need God to move heaven and earth.”
- rth.”
  “I think I would probably go crazy if I was 35 or 40 and didn’t have some competition in my life,”
- Dopamine doesn’t come equipped with a conscience. Rather, it is a source of cunning fed by desire. When it’s revved up, it suppresses feelings of guilt, which is an H&N emotion. It is capable of inspiring honorable effort, but also deceit and even violence in pursuit of the things it wants.
- Dopamine pursues more, not morality; to dopamine, force and fraud are nothing more than tools.
- people who won competitions, as opposed to winning by pure luck, developed a sense of entitlement that allowed them to justify subsequent cheating
- winning competitions that gives us access to food and reproductive partners
- winning competitions releases dopamine.
- the rush of pleasure we feel when we send the tennis ball flying over the net, get a good grade on a test, or receive praise from our boss
- The surge of dopamine feels good, but it’s different from a surge of H&N pleasure, which is a surge of satisfaction.
- the dopamine surge triggered by winning leaves us wanting more.
- WINNING TO KEEP FROM LOSING
- Winning is never enough. Nothing is ever enough for dopamine. It is the pursuit that matters, and the victory, but there is no finish line, and never will be. Winning, like drugs, can be addictive.
- No one likes to lose, but it’s ten times as bad after you win.
- Winners cheat for the same reason that drug addicts take drugs
- Both know that their behavior has the potential to destroy their lives, but the desire circuit doesn’t care. It only wants more. More drugs, more success.
- HOT AND COLD VIOLENCE
## New highlights added May 12, 2022 at 8:27 AM
- Paranoia makes them feel afraid, and sometimes they conclude that the only way to protect themselves is to kill the people they imagine are plotting against them
- Violence is sometimes the result of dysfunction or pathology. But most of the time, violence is a choice—a coercive and calculated way to get the thing you want.
- Aggression driven by passion is a lashing out at provocation. This is not a calculated action orchestrated by the dopamine control circuit—just the opposite. When passion drives aggression in response to provocation, dopamine is suppressed by the H&N circuits, and people who display this type of aggression usually degrade their future well-being.
- Emotion overwhelms control dopamine’s consideration, caution, and calculation.
- someone with a highly active control circuit might be cold and calculating, ruthless and devoid of emotion.
- The brain is complicated, and the way in which activity in one circuit is translated into behavior depends on activity in many other circuits all working together.
- They are obsessed with making the future more rewarding at the expense of being able to experience the joys of the present.
- **Emotion is an H&N experience**
- **It’s what we feel right here, right now. Emotion is critical to our ability to understand the world, but emotions can sometimes overwhelm us. When that happens, we make less-logical decisions.**
- *One of our evolutionary ancestors, one endowed with a particularly robust dopamine control circuit, might respond to a charging lion by suppressing the urge to panic, and instead of trying to outrun the lion, he calmly picks up a burning stick from his fire to frighten it away.*
- **When bold action is required in the midst of chaos, the one who can stay calm, take stock of available resources, and quickly develop a plan of action is the one who will pull through.**
- . I could feel utter panic approaching, and I knew that if I allowed it to control me, I would lose my ability to think
- To save myself, I had to start thinking. I radioed a Mayday message, then my crewman and I got to work on the sails and used them to steer us out of the reef
- He wasn’t running on adrenaline; he was running on dopamine. During the intense moments when he saved the boat, dopamine was in control and adrenaline (called norepinephrine when it is inside the brain) was suppressed
- Some people are naturally better at suppressing emotion than others.
- If we’re engaged with the peripersonal—up close, in direct contact, focused on the present moment—H&N circuits are activated, and the warm, emotional aspects of our personality come out. When we’re engaged in the extrapersonal—at a distance, thinking abstractly, focused on the future—the rational, emotionless parts of our personality are more likely to be seen. These two different ways of thinking are illustrated by the ethics dilemma called “the trolley problem”:
- But since **H&N’s strongest influence is in the peripersonal space**—in the immediate realm of what the five senses tell us—what would happen if we moved back, one step at a time, incrementally diminishing H&N’s influence on our decision? Does our willingness—our ability—to trade one life for five increase as we get literally farther away from our victim, as we move out of the H&N peripersonal space into the dopaminergic extrapersonal?
- **It’s almost as if there were two separate minds evaluating the situation**. One mind is rational, making decisions based on reason alone. The other is empathic, unable to kill a man, regardless of the big-picture outcome. One seeks to dominate the situation by imposing control to maximize the number of lives saved; the other does not. Whether a person chooses one outcome or the other partly depends on activity within the dopamine circuits.
- **Sometimes we act one way: cold, calculating, seeking to dominate the environment for future gain. Sometimes we act another: warm, empathic, sharing what we have for the present joy of making others happy.**
- Dopamine control circuits and H&N circuits work in opposition, creating a balance that allows us to be humane toward others, while safeguarding our own survival.
- **Willpower isn’t the only tool control dopamine has in its arsenal when it needs to oppose desire.** **It can also use planning, strategy, and abstraction, such as the ability to imagine the long-term consequences of alternate choices.**
- But when we need to resist harmful urges, willpower is the tool we reach for first.
- Willpower is like a muscle.
- Resisting temptation seems to have produced a psychic cost, in the sense that afterward participants were more inclined to give up easily in the face of frustration.”
- **If you’re on a diet, the more times you resist temptation, the more likely you are to fail the next time around.** *Willpower is a limited resource*.
- If willpower is like a muscle, can it be strengthened through exercise? *Yes, but it requires some high tech “exercise equipment*
- Strengthening willpower was possible, but it required a high-tech window that allowed the test participants to look deep inside their brains.
- You can’t beat drugs with willpower alone. It takes more than that.
- Even though it’s possible to strengthen willpower, it’s still not the answer to long-term, enduring change

## Highlights
- part of them wants nothing more than to use drugs, but there are other, weaker desires as well.
- **desire not only gives us motivation to act; it also gives us patience to endure**
- The goal of the therapy is to stoke the flames of desire for a better life.
- COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY: CONTROL DOPAMINE VERSUS DESIRE DOPAMINE
- It’s better to be smart than strong.
- Instead of trying to attack an addiction head on through willpower, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) uses the planning ability of control dopamine to defeat the raw power of desire dopamine.
- Desire dopamine cranks up, motivating the addict to use, and threatening to shut down completely if it doesn’t get what it wants
- ￼   ADDICTION:   ￼
  IT’S WORSE THAN YOU THINK
- Addictions are hard to treat, harder than many other psychiatric illnesses. With other illnesses, such as depression, patients want to get better—there’s no question about it. But if a person is addicted to a drug, he’s not so sure.
- These triggers may be so subtle that the person may not recognize them until after they succumb to temptation.
- photos taken with friends at a tailgate party, a favorite glass, a bottle opener, even a kitchen knife used to slice lemons
- DNA alteration makes drinkers consume alcohol in spite of unpleasant consequences.
- Rats with addiction-modified DNA drank more alcohol, and they drank even when the alcohol was spiked with quinine, which has a bitter taste that rats normally avoid
- TWELVE-STEP FACILITATION THERAPY: H&N VERSUS DESIRE DOPAMINE
- **The level of H&N empathy for the developing fetus is so high that many women smokers jump right to the finish line and stop smoking without any conscious effort at all.**
- **Once the dopaminergic rationalization of I’m not hurting anyone but myself breaks down, the door opens for a rapid readjustment in the H&N–dopamine balance.**
- T*he dopamine system as a whole evolved to maximize future resources*
- we also possess a more sophisticated circuit that gives us the ability to think long term, make plans, and use abstract concepts such as math, reason, and logic
- *The control circuit suppresses H&N emotion, allowing us to think in a cold, rational way that’s often required when hard decisions need to be made, such as sacrificing the well-being of one person for the benefit of others.*
- **Sometimes it charges straight ahead and dominates a situation through the power of confidence**. **Other times it leads to submissive behaviors that induce others to cooperate with us, multiplying our ability to get things done and reach our goals**
- It gives us the ability to bend the environment and even other people to our will. But dopamine can do more than give us dominion over the world: it can create entirely new worlds, worlds that may be so astonishing, they could have been created only by a genius—or a madman.
- The creative mind is the most potent force on earth. No oil well, gold mine, or thousand-acre farm can compete with the wealth-producing possibilities of a creative idea. Creativity is the brain at its best. Mental illness is the opposite.
- BREAKING WITH REALITY
- The most common type of hallucination is the auditory hallucination—hearing voices. The voices may comment on the person’s behavior (“You’re eating lunch now.”)
- Nash looked up at last and fixed Mackey with an unblinking stare as cool and dispassionate as that of any bird or snake. “Because,” Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, as if talking to himself, “the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did.”
- **Stimulation of the desire circuit typically leads to excitement, wanting, enthusiasm, and motivation**
- SALIENCE AND THE DOPAMINE CONNECTION
- **Things are salient when they are important to you, if they have the potential to impact your well-being, for good or for evil.**
- Things are salient if they have the potential to affect your future. Things are salient if they trigger desire dopamine. They broadcast the message, Wake up. Pay attention. Get excited. This is important
- PSYCHOTIC SHORT CIRCUIT
- The triggering event rises from obscurity to importance.
- If you’re playing a video game, trying to defeat the boss, or applying for a new job, it would be nice to experience a little excitement to create the motivation that pushes things forward.
- Being cut off from natural dopamine surges makes the world a dull place and makes it hard to find reasons to get out of bed in the morning.
- DRINKING FROM A FIRE HOSE
- **We inhibit our ability to notice things that are unimportant so we don’t have to waste our attention on them. If**
- If we attach equal significance to the color of a person’s tie and the expression on his face, we may fail to observe something very important to our future well-being.
- If you’re in an exotic foreign country, there’s not much to inhibit, and it can cause great pleasure but also confusion and disorientation—culture shock
- When I’m in a country radically different from my own, I notice much more. It is as if I’ve taken a mind-altering drug that allows me to see things I would normally miss. I feel much more alive.
- As the new environment becomes familiar, we adjust, and eventually master it.
- There may be chaos inside our heads that requires taming by the more logical parts of the brain, but there is also treasure
- Creative thinking requires people to let go of the conventional interpretations of the world in order to see things in a brand-new way. In other words, they must break apart their preconceived models of reality. But what is a model, and why do we build the
- A WORLD BEYOND THE SENSES
- How do we perceive something that is so far away that we can’t even see it? We use our imagination.
- it. In some ways model building is like latent inhibition
- Models not only simplify our conception of the world; they also allow us to abstract, to take specific experiences and use them to craft broad, general rules
- MENTAL TIME TRAVEL
- Using imagination, we project ourselves into various possible futures, mentally experience them, then decide how we’re going to get the most out of what we see—how we’re going to maximize our resources, whether it’s a roomy seat, a cheap ticket, or a fast ride.
- Mental time travel is a powerful tool of the dopamine system. It allows us to experience a possible, though presently unreal, future as if we were there.
- Mental time travel is in constant use because it’s the mechanism for making every conscious choice in life.
- If our models are poor, w****e will make bad predictions about the future and subsequently bad choices
- Poor models of reality may be caused by many things: not having enough information, difficulty with abstract thinking, or the stubborn persistence of wrong assumptions.
- if a child grows up with critical parents, she may develop the conviction that she is an incompetent person, and this belief will shape the models of the world that she creates all her life.
- Knowledge passed on from previous generations can help us improve our models in a different way than direct experience.
- BREAKING MODELS: STARTING DOWN THE PATH OF CREATIVITY
- **If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.**
  —proverb
- Models are powerful tools, but they have disadvantages. They can lock us in to a particular way of thinking, causing us to miss out on opportunities to improve our world.
- Preexisting models have to be taken apart in order to see the problem in a fresh way
- The riddle draws you into a calendar-based model, leading you to inhibit apparently irrelevant information, such as the letters that make up the words
- I’m in years but not months. I’m in weeks but not days. What am I?
  This riddle is difficult, and unless you’ve heard it before or have low latent inhibition, it’s unlikely you’ll figure out that the answer is the letter e.
- Finding the neural basis of creativity has enormous potential, because creativity is the most valuable resource in the world
- Pairing a brand-new idea with an old familiar one makes the new idea easier to understand.
- The ability to draw a connection between two things that had previously appeared to be unrelated is an important part of creativity, and it appears that it can be enhanced by electrical stimulation.
- DREAMS: WHERE CREATIVITY AND MADNESS MINGLE
- Dreams often contain the theme of up, such as flying or falling from a great height. Dreams often involve future themes, too, sometimes in the form of the pursuit of some intensely desired goal that’s always just out of reach. Abstract, detached from the real world of the senses, dreams are dopaminergic.
- Dreams are brief madness and madness a long dream
- Dopamine is unleashed during dreaming, freed from the restraining influence of the reality-focused H&N neurotransmitters. Activity in the H&N circuits is suppressed because sensory input from the outside world into the brain is blocked. This freedom allows dopamine circuits to generate the bizarre connections that are the hallmark of dreams
- HOW TO HARVEST CREATIVITY FROM A DREAM
- sometimes when we’re asleep we dream, and other times we don’t. As we make the transition from sleep to wakefulness, is our thought process different if we are waking from a dream or from dreamless sleep?
- Many people have had the experience of waking from a dream, feeling as if they were caught between two worlds. Thinking is more fluid, making leaps from topic to topic, unconstrained by the rules of logic
- dreams are inner representations of inner ideas. Cut off from the senses, dreams allow dopamine to run free, unconstrained by the concrete facts of external reality.
- Much of the brain is every bit as active during dreaming as it is when it is awake, but there are crucial differences.
- the frontal lobes, are shut down.
- But there is increased activity in an area called the secondary visual cortex. This part of the brain doesn’t receive signals directly from the eyes, which receive no input during dreaming. Instead, it is responsible for processing visual stimuli. It helps the brain make sense of what the eyes are seeing.
- **ordinary people can use dreams to solve practical problems**, too. Dr. Barrett put the problem-solving power of dreams to the test in a group of Harvard undergraduate students.
- she taught them dream incubation techniques. These are strategies people can use to increase the likelihood of having a problem-solving dream.
- The problems and the dreams were then submitted to a panel of judges who decided if the dream really did provide a solution
- 70 percent of those who dreamed about the problem believed their dreams contained a solution. The independent judges mostly agreed. Among the students who had a dream about their problems, the judges deemed that about half offered a solution.
- ￼   DREAM INCUBATION: HOW TO   ￼
  SOLVE PROBLEMS IN YOUR SLEEP
- Choose a problem that’s important to you, one that you have a strong desire to solve. The greater the desire, the more likely it is that the problem will show up in a dream.
- Think about the problem before you go to bed. If possible, put it in the form of a visual image.
- If you’re looking for inspiration, imagine a blank piece of paper. If you’re struggling with some sort of project, imagine an object that represents the project. Hold the image in your mind, so it’s the last thing you think of before you fall asleep.
- Make sure you have a pen and paper next to your bed. As soon as you wake up from a dream, write it down, whether or not you think it’s related to the problem.
- It’s important to write down the dream immediately because the memory will evaporate in seconds if you begin to think about something else.
- Many people have had the experience of waking up from an intense dream, one that’s overflowing with personal meaning, and then being unable to recall any of the details less than a minute later.
- Elite societies of scientists are filled with artistic souls.
- **WHY GENIUSES ARE JERKS**
- deal: if you are highly dopaminergic in one area, you’re likely to be highly dopaminergic in others. Scientists are artists and musicians are mathematicians. But there’s a downside. Sometimes having lots of dopamine is a liability.
- Plato wrote about an incident in which Socrates, the ancient Greek philosopher, stood glued to one spot for an entire day and night, thinking about a problem, completely unaware of what was going on around him.
- he dopaminergic genius is so focused on his internal world of ideas that he wears different-color socks, forgets to comb his hair, and generally neglects anything having to do with the real world of the here and now.
- but they all have something in common. They’re overly focused on maximizing future resources at the expense of appreciating the here and now. The pleasure seeker always wants more. No matter how much he gets, it’s never enough. No matter how much he looks forward to some promised pleasure, he is incapable of finding satisfaction in it.
- As soon as it comes he turns his attention to what’s next. The detached planner also has a future/present imbalance.
- THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES
- Newton was haunted by insanity. He spent hours trying to find hidden messages in the Bible, and wrote over a million words on religion and the occult. He pursued the medieval art of alchemy, obsessively searching for the philosopher’s stone, a mythical substance that alchemists believed had magical properties and could even help humans achieve immortality. At the age of fifty, Newton became fully psychotic and spent a year in an insane asylum
- Newton had elevated levels of dopamine that contributed to his brilliance, his social problems, and his psychotic breakdown. And he’s not alone. Many brilliant artists, scientists, and business leaders are thought or known to have had mental illness.
- Dopamine gives us the power to create. It allows us to imagine the unreal and connect the seemingly unrelated. It allows us to build mental models of the world that transcend mere physical description, moving beyond sensory impressions to uncover the deeper meaning of what we experience. Then, like a child knocking over a tower of blocks, dopamine demolishes its own models so that we can start fresh and find new meaning in what was once familiar.
- heightened dopaminergic activity may overwhelm H&N systems, hampering one’s ability to form human relationships and navigate the day-to-day world of reality.
- **The joy of creation is the most intense joy they know, whether they are artists, scientists, prophets, or entrepreneurs.**
- **They nevera relax, never stop to enjoy the good things they have. Instead, they’re obsessed with building a future that never arrives.**
- Conservative: A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the liberal, who wishes to replace them with others.
- in science, when you find just what you expect, it can be a red flag.
- Liberals often refer to themselves as progressives, a term that implies constant improvement. Progressives embrace change. They imagine a better future and in some cases even believe that the right combination of technology and public policy can eliminate fundamental problems of the human condition such as poverty, ignorance, and war. Progressives are idealists who use dopamine to imagine a world far better than the one we live in today. Progressivism is an arrow pointing forward.
- conservative, on the other hand, implies maintaining the best of what we have inherited from those who came before us. Conservatives are often suspicious of change. They don’t like experts who try to advance civilization by telling them what to do, even when it’s in their own best interest; for example, laws that require motorcyclists to wear helmets, or regulations that promote healthy eating. Conservatives distrust the idealism of progressives, criticizing it as an impossible effort to build a perfect utopia; an effort that is more likely to lead to totalitarianism in which the elite dominate all aspects of public and private life. In contrast to the arrow of progressivism, conservatism is better represented by a circle.
- Dopaminergic people tend to be creative. They also work well with abstract concepts.
- survey of startup founders revealed that 83 percent held the progressive view that education can solve all or most of the problems in society.
- Newly married celebrities are almost six times as likely to divorce compared to ordinary people
- ARE LIBERALS SMARTER?
- Adults who described themselves as very liberal had higher intelligence scores compared to those who described themselves as simply liberal.
- very liberal adults had an IQ of 106 and very conservative ones had an IQ of 95.
- Atheists had an IQ of 103, whereas those who described themselves as very religious averaged 97
- There wasn’t much difference between liberals and conservatives when the press symbol was displayed. But when the no-press signal came up, and the participants had half a second to make a decision, the liberals instantly fired up a part of their brain responsible for error detection (involving anticipation, attention, and motivation) in a way the conservatives did not. When circumstances change, liberals do a better job of rapidly activating neural circuits and adjusting their responses to meet the new challenge.
- IS INTELLIGENCE?   ￼
- the ability to make good day-to-day decisions. For this type of mental activity emotions (H&N) are essential.
- Being in touch with our emotions and processing emotional information skillfully are crucial for almost every decision we make. Intellectual prowess is not enough. Everyone is familiar with the scientific genius or brilliant writer who is like a helpless child in real life because he lacks “common sense”—the ability to make good decisions.
- it wouldn’t be unreasonable to predict that individuals who have a strong H&N system would have an advantage in this area. A high score on an IQ test may be a good predictor of academic success, but for a happy life, emotional sophistication may be more important.
- RECEPTOR GENES AND THE LIBERAL–CONSERVATIVE SPLIT
- HUMANS OR HUMANITY?
- dopaminergic people are more interested in action at a distance and planning, while people with high H&N levels tend to focus on things close at hand
- The hedonistic paradox states that people who seek happiness for themselves will not find it, but people who help others will
- Dopaminergic people want the poor to receive more help, while H&N people want to provide personal help on a one-to-one basis.
- Conservatives have less sex than liberals, possibly because conservatives are more likely to be in companionate relationships in which testosterone is suppressed by oxytocin and vasopressin.
- ARE WE AMUSING   ￼
  OURSELVES TO DEATH?
- another reason fear works so well is loss aversion, meaning that the pain of loss is stronger than the pleasure of gain.
- When scientists performed brain scans during wagering experiments, they naturally looked at dopamine first. They found that neural activity in the desire circuit increased after wins and decreased after losses—as would be expected. But the changes weren’t symmetrical. The magnitude of the decrease after losses was larger than the increase after gains. The dopamine circuit was mirroring the subjective experience. The effect of loss was greater than the effect
- Every time a participant lost a bet, their amygdala fired up, intensifying feelings of distress. It was H&N emotion that was driving loss aversion
- TO PROVIDE OR PROTECT?
- WE HAVE WAYS OF MAKING YOU CONSERVATIVE
- Conservatives are more likely than liberals to focus on threat. At the same time, when people of either inclination feel threatened, they become more conservative. It’s well known that terrorist attacks boost the popularity of conservative candidates
- WE HAVE WAYS OF MAKING YOU LIBERAL
- If introducing threats into the environment makes people more conservative, is it possible to make people more liberal by doing the opposite?
- Activating dopamine pathways is one way to make conservatives think more like liberals. But we can do something similar by exploiting the very circuits that make conservatives act conservatively: the H&N circuits, specifically those that allow us to experience empathy.
- The essence of government is control. People may submit to being controlled as a result of conquest, or they may voluntarily give up some of their freedom in exchange for protection. Either way, a small number of people are given power to exert authority over the rest of the population. It’s a dopaminergic activity because the populace is governed from a distance through abstract laws. Although the threat of H&N violence is used to enforce the law, most people never experience it. They submit to ideas, not physical force.
- it’s easier to maximize resources when emotions are taken out of the picture. Pushing a person onto the tracks to stop a train is nearly impossibl
- Flipping a switch from far away is easier. Similarly, many laws benefit some people but harm others. The farther away you get, the easier it is to tolerate some degree of harm in the service of the greater good. Distance insulates politicians from the immediate consequences of their decisions.
- **WHY WASHINGTON MUST ALWAYS “DO SOMETHING!”**
- This desire for control is unavoidable. Some people in Washington call themselves liberal and others call themselves conservative, but **pretty much everyone involved in politics is dopaminergic. Otherwise they couldn’t get elected**. **Political campaigns require intense motivation**. They require a willingness to sacrifice everything to achieve success
- H&N people, who make relationships with loved ones a priority, can’t succeed in politics.
- As President Harry Truman is credited with saying, **“If you want a friend in Washington, buy a dog.”**
- Growth may never stop. Dopamine’s mandate is more. Change—representing either progress or loss of tradition, depending on one’s point of view—is inevitable. Only H&N circuits can bring about feelings of satisfaction, feelings that the end has been reached and it’s time to stop
- Endorphins, endocannabinoids, and other H&N neurotransmitters tell us that our work is done, and now it’s time to enjoy the fruits of our labor. But dopamine suppresses these chemicals. Dopamine never rests.
- That’s not to say that more government is necessarily bad. Growth of power wielded for the public good can have a positive influence on the lives of millions of people. If the government is benevolent and effective, growing centralized power can help safeguard the rights of the weak and lift the destitute out of poverty. It can protect workers and consumers from exploitation by powerful corporations. But if politicians pass laws that benefit themselves instead of their constituents, if corruption is widespread, or if lawmakers simply don’t know what they are doing, liberty and prosperity will suffer.
- DON’T GET FOOLED AGAIN
- the fundamental obstacle to achieving harmony is that the liberal brain is different from the conservative brain, and that makes it difficult for them to understand each other.
- There are exceptions; there are bad people everywhere, and it’s the bad people who get all the press. They’re more interesting than good people, and they’re useful as political weapons. But they don’t represent the typical Democrat or Republican.
- Most conservatives just want to be left alone. They want the freedom to make their own decisions based on their own values
- . . . the beginning is where the end gets born.
- What happens when the servant becomes the master?
  In which dopamine ensures the survival of early humans and the extinction of the human race
- This migration was essential for the survival of the human race, and there’s genetic evidence that we almost didn’t make
- This high level of genetic similarity suggests that we are all descendants of a relatively small number of ancestors
- In fact, early in our evolutionary history, unknown events killed off a large portion of humans, and the population dwindled to less than 20,000, representing a serious risk of extinction
- When a species is concentrated in a small area, there are many ways in which the entire population can be wiped out. Drought, disease, and other disasters can easily cause extinction. Dispersing throughout many regions, on the other hand, is like an insurance policy. The destruction of one population doesn’t result in total extinction
- THE ADVENTURE GENE
- Research on mice has shown that drugs that boost dopamine also increase exploratory behavior
- A dopamine receptor’s job is to wait for a dopamine molecule to come along and bind to it.
- MORE DOPAMINE, MORE DISTANCE
- The obvious answer is that dopamine makes people seek out more.
- It makes them restless and dissatisfied. It makes them long for something better. These are exactly the kinds of people who would leave an established community to go out and explore the unknown. But there’s another explanation as well.
- SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
- Change is stressful—both good change and bad change.
- One might conceptualize the extraordinary **brain as being similar to a high-performance sports car.** **It’s capable of doing incredible things, but it breaks down easily. Dopamine drives intelligence, creativity, and hard work, but it can also make people behave in bizarre ways.**
- **Cocaine blocks the dopamine transporter like a sock shoved into a vacuum cleaner nozzle. The blockage allows the dopamine to interact with its receptor over and over again. When that happens, people experience increased energy, goal-directed activity, and sexual drive. They have elevated self-esteem, euphoria, and racing thoughts that jump from one topic to another. Cocaine intoxication is so similar to mania that doctors have trouble telling them apart.**
- *The dopamine transporter is like a vacuum cleaner. Its job is to limit the amount of time dopamine spends stimulating the cells around it. When a dopamine-producing cell fires, it releases its store of dopamine, which then binds to receptors on other brain cells. Then, to bring the interaction to an end, the dopamine transporter sucks the dopamine back into the cell where it came from so the process can start all over again.*
- DOPAMINE NATION
- despite living in “the happiest circumstances which the world affords,” Americans pursued a better life with “feverish ardor
- People who had the more active form were almost twice as likely to have started a new business compared to those who had the less active form
- There are a limited number of highly dopaminergic people in the world, so one country’s gain is another country’s loss.
- Dopamine-producing cells make up 0.0005 percent of the brain. That’s a tiny fraction of the cells we use to navigate our world. And yet, when we think about who we are in the deepest sense, we think about that tiny cluster of cells. We identify with our dopamine. In our minds, we are dopamine
- The essence of humanity is our ability to move beyond instinct, to go beyond automatic reactions to our environment. It’s the ability to weigh options, to consider higher concepts such as values and principles, and then to make a deliberate choice about how to maximize what we believe is good—whether it’s love, money, or the ennobling of the soul. That’s dopamine.
- The hedonist believes that his deepest self is the part of him that experiences pleasure. Whether it’s wine, women, or song, his purpose in life is to maximize the rewards he gets when he pursues more. That’s dopamine.
- The academic might say that her essence is the ability to comprehend the world. It’s her ability to rise above the flow of information from the physical senses to understand the meaning of what she perceives. She evaluates, judges, and makes predictions. She understands. That’s dopamine.
- The artist says that the essence of her humanity is her ability to create. It’s her godlike power to call into existence representations of truth and beauty that never existed before. The springs from which that creation flows are her being. That’s dopamine
- the spiritual person might say that transcendence is the root of humanity. It’s the thing that rises above physical reality—the most essential part of who we are is our immortal souls that exist beyond space and time. Because we cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or touch our souls, we encounter them only in our imagination. That’s dopamine.
- Lifting your arm to scratch your head requires the coordination of dozens of muscles in your fingers, wrist, arm, shoulder, back, neck, and abdomen. If you’re standing when you do it, the coordination requirements go all the way down your legs.
- Much of what we do throughout the day is automatic. We walk out the door and go to work with little intentional thought. We drive cars, feed ourselves, laugh, smile, frown, slouch, and do thousands of other things without having to think about them. We do so much that bypasses the part of the brain that weighs options and makes choices, that an argument could be made that those non-conscious actions—non-dopaminergic activities—represent who we really are.
- If we ignore our emotions, lose touch with them, they become less sophisticated over time, and may devolve into anger, greed, and resentment. If we neglect empathy, we lose the ability to make others feel happy. And if we neglect affiliative relationships, we will most likely lose the ability to be happy ourselves—and probably die early.
- A Harvard study that’s been going on for seventy-four years has found that social isolation (even in the absence of feelings of loneliness) is associated with a 50 to 90 percent higher risk of early death.
- The future, where dopaminergic creatures live their lives, is a world of phantoms.
- WILL DOPAMINE DESTROY THE HUMAN RACE?
- When the human race lived in scarcity and on the brink of extinction, the drive for more kept us alive. Dopamine was the engine of progress
- By giving us the ability to create tools, invent abstract sciences, and plan far into the future, it made us the dominant species on the planet. But in an environment of plenty in which we have mastered our world and developed sophisticated technology—in a time when more is no longer a matter of survival—dopamine continues to drive us forward, perhaps to our own destruction.
- Technology develops fast while evolution is slow. Our brains evolved at a time when survival was in doubt. That’s less of a problem in the modern world, but we’re stuck with our ancient brains.
- It’s possible that we won’t last beyond another half-dozen generations.
- In the following sections we’re going to look at worst-case scenarios. It may be that our dopaminergic-driven ingenuity will help us find a safe way through the reefs and shoals of humanity’s ever-accelerating progress. Then again, maybe not. For example:
- PRESS THE BUTTON
- someday someone’s dopamine circuits might come to the conclusion that the best way to maximize future resources is to press the button. We all hope—and many believe—that before we destroy ourselves, humanity will find a way to move beyond our primitive drive for conquest, possibly through organizations of international cooperation such as the United Nations.
- FINISH OFF THE PLANET
- Climate change accelerated by industrial activity is a major focus of countries around the world that fear devastating consequences, including drought, floods, and violent competition for diminishing resources. More than half of greenhouse gases are generated by burning fossil fuel to make cement, steel, plastics, and chemicals.
- more isn’t the pursuit of luxury
- LET’S ALL WELCOME OUR NEW SILICON OVERLORDS
- Once computers become smart enough to build—and improve—themselves, their progress will accelerate dramatically
- Ray Kurzweil, the world’s leading futurologist, believes that we will have superintelligent computers as early as the year 2029
- Newer developments in artificial intelligence, however, create unpredictable results. Instead of the programmer determining how the computer works, the computer modifies itself based on how successful it is in reaching its goal.
- An artificial intelligence that programs its own circuits might one day come to the conclusion that eliminating the human race is the best way to accomplish its goal.
- option is to simply stop making computers with artificial intelligence. However, that would diminish our ability to pursue more, so we can rule that out. Dopamine will drive the science forward whether it’s good for us or not. We may get lucky, though. We may discover a way to ensure that artificial intelligences act in ethical ways. Many experts in the field believe that should be a top priority for computer scientists.
- EVERYTHING. ALL THE TIME.
- Dopamine drives our lives faster and faster. It takes more education to keep up. A graduate degree is as necessary today as a college education was a generation ago.
- In developed countries, people have pretty much lost interest in having children. Raising kids costs a lot of money. A
- Future-focused dopamine no longer drives couples to have children because people who live in developed countries don’t depend on their children to support them in their old age.
- Government-funded retirement plans take care of that. That frees up dopamine to move on to other things like TVs, cars, and remodeled kitchens.
- DO NOTHING, EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING
- VR already creates compelling experiences in which the participant is transported to beautiful, exciting locations to become the hero of the universe—instantly.
- Why bother having sex with a needy, repetitive, imperfect partner when an ever-changing fantasy can be had instead? Pornography is about to become a lot more addictive by entering the realm of touch. Devices have recently come to market that deliver genital stimulation synchronized with pornographic VR—essentially sex toys manipulated by a computer. There’s a lot of money at stake. In 2016 the market for sex toys was $15 billion, with projections that it will surpass $50 billion by 2020.
- VR produces images and sound, with other sensory modalities coming online soon. For instance, researchers in Singapore have developed what they call a “digital taste simulator.” It’s a device with electrodes that deliver current and heat to the tongue.
- Once scientists master all the basic flavors, they’ll be able to combine them in different proportions to allow the tongue to experience the sensation of tasting almost any food imaginable. Since what we perceive as taste is, in large part, smell, there’s also a device that features an aromatic diffuser that simulates smells.
- The computer will become so adept at fulfilling our desires that no human will be able to compete. The next step will be bodysuits that will allow us to experience virtual sex with all our senses, without the inconvenience of reproduction.
- With VR, the human race may go willingly into the dark night. Our dopamine circuits will tell us it’s the best thing ever.
- There’s only one thing that will save us: the ability to achieve a better balance, to overcome our obsession with more, appreciate the unlimited complexity of reality, and learn to enjoy the things we have.
- Do you wish to be great? Then begin by being. Do you desire to construct a vast and lofty fabric? . . . The higher your structure is to be, the deeper must be its foundation.
- I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.
- In which dopamine and H&Ns find balance.
- HARMONY
- a person can be disabled by both an excessive focus on the future and an excessive enjoyment of the present.
- Dopamine and the H&N neurotransmitters evolved to work together.
- The modern world drives us to be all dopamine, all the time. Too much dopamine can lead to productive misery, while too much H&N can lead to happy indolence
- the workaholic executive versus the pot-smoking basement dweller
- Neither one is living a truly happy life or growing as a person. To live a good life, we need to bring them back into balance
- How can the ordinary person find balance?
- We have to find balance in other ways. Dopamine alone will never satisfy us. It can’t provide satisfaction any more than a hammer can turn a screw. But it’s constantly promising us that satisfaction is right around the corner: one more donut, one more promotion, one more conquest. How do we get off the treadmill? It’s not easy, but there are ways.
- MASTERY: THE PLEASURE OF BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING
- When mastery is achieved, dopamine has reached the pinnacle of its aspiration—squeezing every last drop out of an available resource. This is what it’s all about. This is the moment to savor—now, in the present. Mastery is the point at which dopamine bows to H&N.
- Mastery also creates a feeling of what psychologists call an internal locus of control.
- In addition to making people feel good, an internal locus of control also makes people more effective. People with a strong sense of internal locus of control are more likely to achieve academic success and get high-paying jobs.
- Mastering a skill requires a student to constantly move outside her comfort zone. As soon as a piano player gets good at an easy song, she has to start on a harder one. It’s a tough slog, but it can also be a great joy. Those who don’t give up generally feel it was worth it. It can result in a feeling that they have found their passion, something so engrossing they become completely immersed in it.
- THE REWARDS OF REALITY
- What dopamine loves more than anything else is reward prediction error, which, as we have discussed, is the discovery that something is better than we had anticipated it would be.
- Reward prediction error feels great because your dopamine circuits get excited over the fact that there is something new and unexpected to make your life better.
- Paying attention to reality, to what you are actually doing in the moment, maximizes the flow of information into your brain. It maximizes dopamine’s ability to make new plans, because to build models that will accurately predict the future, dopamine needs data, and data flows from the senses. That’s dopamine and H&N working together
- GO AHEAD AND TAKE A MICROBREAK . .
- Nature is complex. It’s made up of systems with many interacting parts. Unexpected patterns emerge as a result of a large number of elements influencing one another. There’s a virtually limitless amount of detail to explore.
- natural scene stimulated both “sub-cortical arousal” (desire dopamine) and “cortical attention control” (control dopamine).
- That approach to architecture, using H&N stimulation to activate dopamine, is not only good for the soul—it may also be good for the bottom line.
  . . . BUT DON
- . . BUT DON’T TRY TO MULTITASK
- Almost any experience is improved by paying full attention to it.
  —Kelly McGonigal, Lecturer in Management, Stanford School of Business
- multitasking, or paying attention to more than one thing at a time, is impossible.
- When you attempt to do more than one thing, such as talking on the telephone while reading an email, you shift your attention between the tasks, and end up compromising on both.
- Sometimes you pause while reading the email to listen to the person on the phone; other times you stop listening as you focus on the email. The person you’re talking to can tell. You’re obviously not giving him your full attention, and you miss important details. Instead of increasing your efficiency, “multitasking” decreases it.
- Spell aloud, letter by letter, “Jewelry is shiny” while at the same time printing your name. How long does it take? Now spell aloud, letter by letter, “Jewelry is shiny” and then, after you are done with that, write your name. How long did that take? Probably about half as much time as “multitasking” did.
- Interruptions of only a few seconds, the amount of time it takes to switch to your email program and back, can double the number of errors you make on a task that requires concentration. It’s not just the distraction that causes the mistakes; switching back and forth consumes mental energy, and fatigue makes it harder to concentrate. Still, people do it, especially people who work with computers.
- Those who spent less time before jumping to something else experienced higher levels of stress and got less work done—if for no other reason than that they repeated the “switch tasks” maneuver four hundred times instead of only once after each task was completed. In addition to decreasing productivity, high levels of stress also cause fatigue and burnout.
- THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE FUTURE
- Living our lives in the abstract, unreal, dopaminergic world of future possibilities comes at a cost, and that cost is happiness
- Over five thousand people from eighty-three countries volunteered to be in the study.
- In every other situation, though, thinking about other things happened so frequently that the researchers concluded that a wandering mind, what scientists call stimulus-independent thought, was the brain’s default mode.
- people were less happy when their mind was wandering, and once again, it didn’t matter what the activity was
- t “a human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind
- By spending time in the present, we take in sensory information about the reality we live in, allowing the dopamine system to use that information to develop reward-maximizing plans.
- Creating something new, something that has never been conceived of before is, by definition, surprising. Because it is always new, creation is the most durable of the dopaminergic pleasures.
- STIR IT UP
- Creativity is an excellent way to mix together dopamine and H&N
- Woodworking, knitting, painting, decorating, and sewing are old-fashioned activities that don’t get much attention in our modern world—which is exactly the point. These activities don’t require smartphone apps or high-speed internet. They require brains and hands working together to create something new. Our imagination conceives the project. We develop a plan to carry it out. Then our hands make it real.
- Not everyone has the time or inclination to learn how to paint, but that doesn’t mean that creating beauty is out of reach. Coloring books for adults have mystified some and satisfied many
- Cooking, gardening, and playing sports are among many activities that combine intellectual stimulation with physical activity in a way that will satisfy us and make us whole. These activities can be pursued for a lifetime without becoming stale. You might get a few weeks of dopaminergic thrills by buying an expensive Swiss timepiece, but after that it’s just a watch.
- Creativity is different because it stirs together H&N with dopamine. It’s like mixing little bit of carbon with iron to make steel. The result is stronger and more durable. That’s what happens to dopaminergic pleasure when you add physical H&N.
- most people don’t bother to engage in acts of creation, like drawing pictures, making music, or building model airplanes. There’s no practical reason to do these things. They’re hard, at least in the beginning, and they probably won’t earn us money or prestige or guarantee us a better future. But they might make us happy.
- THE POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS
- Construction workers take abstract plans and make them real. They use their minds and their hands. They also enjoy a high degree of camaraderie.
- TINYpulse believed that happiness was essential to a company’s success, so they looked at happiness in a broad range of industries, including the glamorous fields of technology, finance, and biotech. None of them came out on top. The happiest people were construction workers
- Affiliative relationships in the context of the work environment played a key role: work and friendship, dopamine and H&N
- Our dopamine circuits are what make us human. They are what give our species its special power. We think. We plan. We imagine. We elevate our thoughts to ponder abstract concepts such as truth, justice, and beauty. Within those circuits we transcend all barriers of space and time. We thrive in the most hostile environments—even in outer space—thanks to our ability to dominate the world around us
- But these same circuits can also lead us down a darker path, a path of addiction, betrayal, and misery. If we aim to be great, we will probably have to accept the fact that misery will be a part of it. It’s the goad of dissatisfaction that keeps us at our work while others are enjoying the company of family and friends.
- those of us who prefer a life of happy fulfillment have a different task to accomplish: the task of finding harmony. We have to overcome the seduction of endless dopaminergic stimulation and turn our backs on our never-ending hunger for more.

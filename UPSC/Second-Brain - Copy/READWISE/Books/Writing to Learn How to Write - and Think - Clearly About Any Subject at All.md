## Highlights
- One is the fear of writing
- Most people have to do some kind of writing just to get through the day—a memo, a report, a letter—and would almost rather die than do it.
- fear of subjects we don’t think we have an aptitude for.
- these fears are largely unnecessary burdens to lug through life.

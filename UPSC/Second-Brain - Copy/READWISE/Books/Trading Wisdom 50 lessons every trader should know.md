## Highlights
- brief career as an amateur poker player also guide my approach, paying proper respect to risk management and the study of one's opponent.
- My early days of trading were filled with frustration, confusion and constant losses. After making some of the same mistakes over and over again I began to adapt and learned a few tricks to minimize my losses.
- My career and brand have been built on “helping new traders avoid my old mistakes” and this book is a natural extension of those efforts.
- I have personally made every single mistake mentioned in this book multiple times and therefore can speak from the heart, which I hope makes each lesson a little bit easier to learn.
- Lesson 1 - Respect your funds
- “Treat your money right or it will find a new owner.”
- In the process of finding good risk/reward opportunities, avoid over exposing yourself when there is no reason to do so.
- “In trading, the minute you let your guard down is when the capital destruction begins. Stay vigilant and respect your funds.”
- Many refuse to pay for training materials or premium educational sites but they have no problem allocating major funds for high risk short term trades.
- As your trading skill improves, your ability to properly utilize your capital will as well, and over time that will lead to bigger wins and smaller losses.
- Either take trading seriously by studying hard and investing in yourself, or go find a new hobby.
- “Always amazes me that some people are willing to risk $50,000 or more on speculative trades but refuse to read a trading textbook that might cost $70-$100.”
- Lesson 2 - What's the rush?
- “If you are in a rush to trade, do not be surprised if your money is in a rush to go somewhere else.”
- Every trade you execute should be well thought out ahead of time.
- When you rush into your trades you are prone to making simple mistakes
- Going too fast and clicking the wrong button can lead to disaster, so always take a deep breath and go slow when you enter your trade.
- Most of the time in these bottoming situations I lose money when I fool around throwing in bids before any type of bottoming pattern has even started to form. Wait for things to settle down and identify a solid idea that you can use as your fail point.”
- it is really difficult to stay away from trading when I think something is in the process of bottoming.
- When this happens an incredible urge to jump in to the action comes over me. Since I do not want to miss that perfect entry I scale into every minor bottoming formation I see only to get stopped out minutes later.
- More times than not the bottom is slow to form, so there is plenty of time to jump in on a support re-test, diagonal break or horizontal break.
- “My best advice is to follow momentum. Don't be fancy and try to anticipate when it is going to turn around.”
- Traders talk about “catching falling knives”, referring to the process of anticipating a bottom before it has formed. Messing around and trying to catch falling knives will shred your bankroll, unless you are a pro.
- “If you are going to throw some serious funds at something, at least do yourself a favor and take a look at the chart first.”
- Sometimes you see an idea in a chat room or a news article that catches your attention and makes you feel the instant need to open up a new position.
- No matter what you should look at the chart first and try to understand the direction of the trend, as well as where you are buying in relation to major support and resistance.
- “Remember folks, it’s a marathon not a sprint so pace yourself.”
- Lesson 3 - Stay calm under pressure
- “In many ways the difference between success and failure comes down to staying calm under pressure. Do not panic.”
- you must stay cool under pressure so that you can take advantage of bargain basement prices when they come around.
- When panic hits the market it is time for you to go to work because other people are making bad decisions, allowing you the opportunity to capitalize
- “The next time $BTC #Bitcoin drops $10,000 in a day (and it will) try to remember that is a buying opportunity, not a panicking opportunity.”
- The ability to stay calm when the market is blood red will help you to spot favorable risk/reward setups developing in an otherwise hectic environment.
- “If you are a bull then pullbacks are your best friend. The more we digest, the higher we go.”
- come up with a great plan for entering on a retracement, but as soon as it happens you get nervous and change your mind?
- now I stick to my plan, trust myself and see the idea all the way through.
- “If you loved these alts 5 minutes ago, you should ADORE them after a 10-20% haircut. Stop chasing the green and learn to love the red. It is valentines day after all.”
- Lesson 4 - Wait for opportunity
- I do not know who needs to hear this but: You do not have to be in a trade every second. It is okay to watch and wait for a really good opportunity.”
- Instead why not just casually watch the price action while you wait for a really good spot?
- One way is to set low ball bids ahead of time. Place these orders so low in fact that you do not think they have a shot at filling
- set an alert on your phone or trading software to tell you when the price gets close by, and go for a walk
- The difference between a forced trade and a real opportunity is not always easy to see when you are in the moment, but patience will help you spot the difference.
- “Stop trying to predict what is going to happen next and observe, you just might learn something.”
- Funds sitting idly in your trading account should not be the reason for the trade. Rather, the reason should be a clear and defensible trading opportunity based on a clean thesis.
- “Sometimes doing nothing is the hardest trade, but is often the best trade.”
- It can be really frustrating to sit around and wait for a good trading setup, especially when you are sitting on a pile of cash
- it is better to miss a move than to get in at the wrong time
- “In poker, you don’t have to play every hand, you learn a lot by watching. Same for trading - avoid the FOMO, and sit back and observe the action instead.”
- Trading is similar to poker in the sense that it is tempting to enter a new play just to cure your boredom.
- While you dream of big gains in a short period of time, the combination of liquidity and boredom make it tempting to jump into a new play just for some quick action.
- Boredom is not a good enough reason to trade - Wait for opportunity instead.”
- A great way to prevent boredom trading is to use strict criteria for entering any trade, and only initiating a position if all of those conditions are met.
- When you are ready to initiate a new trading position grab a pen and paper and write down your trade idea. Explain to yourself and any other reader why you think you should open the trade.
- Go for a quick jog or maybe take some time on the exercise bike or even go for a swim, and then come back with a clear head and read what you wrote down previously.
- If after re-reading your trade idea it still makes sense then you can enter the trade.
- “An opportunity is something you know when you see it, everything else is a forced trade.”
- force yourself to have a certain amount of cash on hand at all times
- Always keeping a certain % of your trading portfolio in cash is a great way to make sure that you are ready to take advantage of opportunities when they come along
- “If your entry sucks you are going to play catch up the whole time and will probably make more mistakes. Focus on low ball entries to make things easier on yourself.
- Lesson 5 - Go easy on yourself
- It is important to have a short memory and forgive yourself for poor trading decisions in the past. The alternative is bankroll ruin from a self fulfilling prophecy of failure.”
- If you are just getting started then you do not have the luxury of that experience, so making mistakes is the only way to learn.
- “Step one in trading is to survive your mistakes.”
- Survive and stay in the game so you can learn to become a successful trader.
- “Just because you played the last trade poorly doesn't mean you have to play the next trade poorly - Learn from your mistakes rather than letting them haunt you.”
- Knowing the rules is what gets you to the table. Experience is what keeps you at the table as you manage risk and wait for a good opportunity.
- Lesson 6 – Experience comes first
- properly manage your funds based on an understanding of the risk/reward offered by each type of trading setup
- “The minute you stop learning is the minute you give up on yourself.”
- When you think about your time away from the physical process of trading, how much effort are you exerting to improve your craft? Are you studying textbooks and watching educational videos on technical analysis? Are you taking time out of the weekend to identify key chart price levels for the following week's action?
- “If you survive a bad trading mistake then you have paid for that lesson. Don't let it go to waste.”
- Put in the work to improve your craft, and take advantage of the many great people and organizations out there that are willing to help you.
- Push yourself as hard as you can to survive and thrive as a trader.
- “No skill worth having can be achieved without practice. That includes trading.”
- Lesson 7 - Keep grinding
- There are so many things that can go wrong and make you want to give up trading. Most of them come after breaking basic rules like always using a stop loss or never investing more than 10% of your bankroll in any one play.
- “The minute you give up is the minute your doubters win. Prove them wrong.”
- The fact that someone else doubts us is a great motivator as we want to prove them wrong.
- Not only that but we want them to feel bad because we became successful despite everything they said.
- Keep grinding! Don't let anyone tell you that you can not get to where you want to be.
- Lesson 8 - Don't marry your bags
- as soon as I had a larger than average position size I became attached to that play. When the market was closed I scanned the message boards and twitter feeds to see what people were saying about it,
- “Emotions are great when you are painting or writing or composing music, but when you are trading they are kryptonite.”
- Losing money is frustrating because you thought you had a good plan and then everything fell apart
- Another way to get in trouble is after taking profit on a winning trade that keeps going up after you sell. Now you are frustrated and you get mad at yourself, and mad at the play for not going down immediately after you sold.
- "Avoid the impulse to let one bad trade ruin your day. Stay focused and reject the emotion and self loathing
- Lesson 9  - Profit taking
- “When you are so excited about your trade that you take a screen shot to send to your buddy, that is probably when you should sell.”
- One of the hardest things to do is learn how and when to take profit
- When you are in something that is up-trending it is really tempting to just let your position ride to see if it can turn in to a home-run.
- hand, if you do not sell near resistance/supply the price might drop quickly and then your trade becomes a hold, something you were hoping to avoid.
- you should scale in and scale out of each position, so that as you approach a major resistance area there is nothing wrong with trimming some profit
- If the price dips further you can add some back, and if not you still have a core position to take advantage of any continued momentum.
- “Taking profit along the way makes all future decisions easier.”
- Every time you take profit on your trade your remaining position is smaller and that makes each future decision easier
- it is okay to miss out on that extra 5 or 10% in profit because timing the exact top and bottom is pretty much impossibl
- “If you are up big now, maybe take a little off the table. You can never go broke by taking profit.

- Lesson 10 - Emotional mindfulness
- “Any trade that makes you feel uncomfortable should be closed immediately.”
- once I did I realized that I had been improperly sizing my trading positions.
- There is no set rule for how big or how small your position should be, or even exactly how aggressively to scale into it. Each trader must decide based on their own trading style, risk tolerance and personal needs.
- “If  you buy something and immediately feel uncomfortable, you probably have too much money in that play.”
- Now you are so uncomfortable with your position that it is hard to take your eyes of the screen. Every tick up or down makes you sweat, because you have committed more money than you can afford to lose and can not figure out how to get out of this mess.
- play with money you can afford to lose
- Another way to stop this cycle is to take a break from trading and let things settle down for a bit
- After taking some time to decompress you will be in a much better position to re-enter the fight with your wits about you. Ta
- “Trading without mindfulness is pure gambling.”
- “If you enter a trade thinking you are going to lose money, then chances are you will lose money. Be mindful of your mood / confidence level. If you are unable to visualize success, sit out the trade.”
- Lesson 11- Be ready to buy the fear
- “Everyone wants a pullback until it actually comes.”
- When the price is moving up quickly and enthusiasm is extremely high, all we want is pullback so we can add some more shares with confidence.
- once the price breaks support and starts to go lower we start to panic and are not sure if we want to buy anymore
- Not only that but we are now thinking about selling, and we are mad that we did not take profit at “the top”
- When the market is in free fall mode and it feels like everyone is giving up left and right, that is usually a great time to add some exposure.
- “One of the hardest things to do is train yourself to buy weakness, rather than selling in to it.”
- you are buying weakness in a strong chart.
- “Buy when no one else wants it, sell when everyone else wants it.”
- It is important to avoid the cycle of buying the top and selling the bottom.
- If you find yourself constantly chasing tickers that are moving and then easily giving up after some consolidation, then you are going to watch your bankroll evaporate.
- Always keep some extra cash just in case a big price drop happens on one of your favorite plays, and buy that dip with confidence.
- “I am sensing some fear in the market - That means you should have cash ready in case we get any kind of flash dip.
- Lesson 13 - Manage your stack
- “Scale in at support, scale out at resistance, have a tight logical stop loss and the rest is pure luck.”
- limit each play or trade to a certain % of your total portfolio, perhaps 1-5%.
- I coach to all successful traders to cap their trading account at a certain number and transfer out profits every week/month. That way you are less tempted to ape up the risk threshold.”
- Managing the connection between your trading account and your bank account is also incredibly important
- take some of that extra profit and transfer it out to your bank account.
- taking out the money makes it feel real and locks up the gains, and second limiting you trading account size limits your volatility.
- Generally speaking your goals should be humble, and your approach to reaching them methodical.
- Start small with the goal of making one 5% winner this week, and go from there.
- If you do not reach that goal, examine your methodology and record it in a trading log and journal for analysis.
- If you do make your goal perhaps move your target up to a 7% winner, or try to make two 5% winners the following week.
- Rather than trying to grow your account from $5,000 to $50,000 overnight, approach trading with more modest goals based on your experience, and factoring in mistakes you expect to make in pursuit of your goals.
- Remember to pay attention to each step along the way as you are learning, because in the end that is what will make you a winning trader.
- “One decent trade can make up for 10 failed trades if you properly manage your stop losses. You don’t need home runs in this game. Singles, stolen bases and sac flies are good enough.”
- Lesson 14 - Pick your spots carefully

- “If you are not making money in this market chances are that are you trying to fight the trend - Trade WITH the trend, not against it.”

## Highlights
- when I enter in the middle of the channel, rather than buying on a support re-test or shorting at resistance.
- That "no-trade zone" you hear about is real, so if you respect it your wallet will thank you.
- “Follow the price action - Once it tells you where supply and demand lay, pay attention.”
- One of the basic rules of classical charting is that you should not trade against the trend, so in a bull flag you should be looking to go long at the bottom of the channel, rather than looking for spots to short at the top of that channel.
- when the price is consolidating in some type of sideways range like a bear rectangle. You want to initiate your short at the top of that range (resistance), rather than right at the bottom of that range (support), or in the middle of the channel. Sell the strength in a downtrend as that is a move against the primary trend.
- you want to be initiating your position at the correct place in the channel so that you have the best shot to turn that trade into some profit
- “Never buy in the middle of the channel. Either short at resistance, or buy at support. There are so many different things to play/ways to play them so you should be selective.”
- “Cut your losers, add to your winners and the rest is history.”
- Lesson 15 - Stick with what works
- Everyone has heard of the phrase “averaging down”, but how about “averaging up
- When your trade turns green and breaks some resistance or support level confirming your trade thesis that is a good time to “average up” and increase your position size
- it is advantageous for you to increase your risk amount and ride the trend. This way you will reap the rewards of continuation.
- it makes sense to add to positive momentum plays and to reduce risk exposure to negative ones.
- If you cut your losing plays early there will be less pressure on your winning plays to make up for those big trading mistakes
- “It's okay to be wrong more than you are right, as long as you cut your losers and add to your winners.”
- Lesson 16 - Switch time-frames wisely
- “A great analogy for trading off the 5 minute chart is driving while completely drunk - You might make it home but eventually it will catch up with you.”
- the quality of the signals you are getting at this low a time frame is quite poor. Why is that?
- in classical charting is that the longer the time frame, the stronger the signal.
- “Think about your chart time frames like a scientist using a microscope.  You need to move around the magnification until things come into focus, so you are comfortable with each time frame and can process each signal in its own context.”
- Rather than zooming in you should be inclined to zoom OUT and take in the bigger picture. Once you have the primary trend figured out, you can move to lower time frames when the price is at a key support or resistance level.
- one thing to keep in mind as you move around the time frames is that you should be careful not to keep changing them to justify your directional bias
- using a standard time frame to generate trading ideas.
- “You can look at any time frame, just as a general rule the longer the time frame the stronger the signal.”
- Lesson 17 – Don't fight the trend, ride it
- “The investor or trader should never attempt to anticipate a reversal, but rather they should wait for the actual reversal and then act with the comfort of trading with the new trend.”
- you should wait for a clear signal to appear and then act on it.
- First of all you want to watch out for volume. We typically see the most volume at the top and the bottom of a chart as the bulls and bears battle for control of momentum.
- Perhaps most important to any reversal is a higher low, the real first step towards generating any bounce.
- As the price approaches this level again the buyers get anxious, and fearing that they might miss out they move their bids up and now the higher low forms.
- Once we all agree that bottom has been put in, our greed kicks in and want it to dip back down to that level so we can load, this time with confidence of the trend in our favor.
- “My best advice to you is to follow momentum. Don't be fancy and try to anticipate when it is going to turn around
- Lesson 18 - Stay focused
- Having 10 or 15 plays at once does not mean you are going to make 10 or 15 times the amount of money. More than likely you are going to lose focus, screw it up and make nothing.”
- If you have too many plays opened at once, you are likely going to miss out on the important clues that the price action is giving you.
- “If you are having trouble trading my advice would be to focus on fewer plays. Reduce your watch-list to 10 or less, and learn the ins and outs of their price action. When a ticker/symbol becomes "familiar" your instincts will kick in.”
- “If you treat trading like a hobby chances are you will be looking for a new hobby soon.”
- Watching sports while trading is not the only way to get in trouble. You can also get in trouble by trading while you are drinking, or doing drugs. When you have money in play you should treat it with respect and that means staying sober so you can have the best chance possible to pull off a winning trade.
- When you are thinking about where the price might go sometime in the future, you are taking your focus away from what is happening in the moment, and that makes you more likely to miss some clues from the price action.
- “Stop trying to predict what price your favorite play is going to be at the end of the year and pay attention to what it is telling you now about the supply/demand dynamic. Less predicting, more observing.
- Lesson 19 – Sell and move on
- Holding on to and watching your red positions is an emotional drain.”
- “If you spend your time obsessing over old losses you have a high probability of generating new ones
- “When I close out a losing trade I delete that ticker/symbol from my watch-list so that I am not tempted to jump back in and "chase after" the money I lost. Go make that money back in something fresh and clean, and preferably up-trending.”
- “If you look at a chart and can not figure out which way it is going in the first few moments, move on. Find a clear signal.”
- Lesson 20 - Trust your first instinct
- If you can not tell, that means the chart has mixed signals and you should move on to something else that can give you a cleaner “read”.
- you should find a trade setup that is clear to you as soon as you set your eyes upon it.
- how does one learn to have that gut feeling, or develop that “muscle memory” to know what a good and bad chart look like at first glance?
- “Gut feeling is underrated. The thing is it only comes with experience and by watching the chart hours and hours a day.”
- Either way after a good amount of time and practice you will learn to get a sense of what you are looking at be it an uptrend, a downtrend or sideways chop
- “If you are watching more chats than charts your system is broken.”
- Lesson 21 - Dangers of social media
- Chat rooms are good but if you are generating all your trade ideas from there it is really easy to end up headed in the wrong direction
- It is possible that you have found a good chat room with veteran traders, but what if it is just a pump and dump group? Sure you might get lucky on that first or second play, but you never know when the people running that group are going to dump on you and that is a real problem
- If you can learn to find plays on your own then you can hold yourself accountable and still learn a great deal in the process.
- “You can feel the hundreds of thousands of people scouring message boards and social media right now to try and find comfort from the posts of others to feel better about their red positions. I get it... my comfort comes from candles and lines on charts.” @chartguys on Twitter
- “The best traders will admit that they have no idea what is about to happen next. Treat anyone who claims otherwise with a degree of caution.”
- The real truth is that the best traders are the ones who are honest and say that they have no idea what is going to happen next, yet they are prepared to trade whatever scenario comes their way.
- All your trades should be planned out well ahead of time, and if not you should spend some time watching the price action before bidding.
- “Never execute a trade based on a single tweet or message you see from someone else. Be a rock, not a blade of grass blowing in the wind.”
- You have to find a way to avoid the “shiny object” trade
- Avoid chasing that shiny object, and instead stick with what you have been watching.
- Lesson 22 - Buy the rumor, sell the news
- “Things always rise in anticipation. That’s why it’s buy the rumor and sell the news. The run already happened.”
- After the news comes out the price begins to fall and all those people who bought weeks ago, they start taking profit. Then after some period of time the price drifts all the way back down to where it started before the news was even rumored, and now the cycle is complete.
- ask yourself if you are buying in anticipation of the event or based on the event itself happening. Ride the way up and take profit as soon as that date arrives, if not beforehand.
## New highlights added June 13, 2022 at 8:45 PM
- Lesson 23 - Trading journal
- “If you find yourself constantly selling the bottom and buying the top, record in a journal how you are feeling and what you are thinking at the time of trade execution and then look back on that later for a bit of mindfulness training.”
- Trading technique is like muscle memory and when you have repeated the same mistakes over and over again it is in your nature to keep repeating those mistakes.
- A trading journal is a great way to give yourself the opportunity to learn from your mistakes, and more importantly a way to keep yourself honest.
- Write down your winning trades, your losing trades and even the ones you don't take. Over time you will learn something as you analyze your trading behaviors and spot your bad habits. Keep yourself honest because no one else is going to.”
- By recording your thoughts and feelings right at the critical decision time you are able to go back later and objectively analyze the trade without letting your current emotions or bias get in the way.
- Big losses should be recorded in red, underlined and bold, and maybe even larger font so that they stick out when you open the journal each time. This way you do not make it so easy to ignore your mistakes, otherwise what is the point of this exercise?
- trading log
- A trading log is similar to a journal but with one big difference. In this case you use an excel spreadsheet to log your entry, exit and profit and loss from each trade. You can also track the fees you pay, how frequently you are trading and pretty much anything else you can put down in number form.
- Trading is a brutal game guys - start small, paper trade, keep a journal and study your mistakes. Learn the ebb and flow before risking big $$$.”
- Some people use weekly/monthly goals, or even a public social media account where they post their wins and losses. Create a structure by which you can benchmark your results and hold yourself accountable, that way you will remain focused on eliminating those repeat mistakes
- Do whatever it takes to survive your mistakes and stay in the game.
- Lesson 24 - Addiction to gambling
- “Am I the only one who finds it calming to just stare at a chart and watch the candles form? Oh wait, that’s addiction.”
- Once you get a taste of that rush that comes from looking at a big brokerage account or a large trading position, your whole attitude changes and you want to feel that way over and over again.
- Gambling addiction leads to the feeling that you must be in a play at all times. You feel the need to make a move no matter what, and often end up forcing the action just to satisfy that need
- Trading recklessly with a big position is also a clear sign that you have a problem
- monitor your behavior and pay attention to how you are feeling and what you are thinking when you are executing these trades.
- Lesson 25 - Fight the FOMO
- Stay patient, stick to your plan and don't let yourself get caught up in the emotion. Be patient, be careful and chose your plays wisely.”
- If all you are worried about is missing the opportunity in front of you rather than protecting your bankroll, then you have fallen victim to FOMO
- “There is no reason to get all worked up and FOMO anything right now when there are a plethora of good setups available.”
- but in reality we should stay away because we have not done our homework
- Sometimes it is a pump and dump scheme that is causing the move to happen, and other times it is a hot rumor that has everyone hyped up.
- An often overlooked part of successful trading is doing proper research first and studying charts ahead of time.
- It is a multi step process, often involving examining the chart on multiple time frames, studying social media and reading the news to evaluate forward looking events. For each of us the exact way in which we arrive at our trade is different, but without a doubt it should be a multi-factor analysis.
- Timing is everything, so if you buy in the middle to upper part of a pump you will be fighting against the tide trying to “fix” your bad trade.
- Why is it so hard to resist FOMO? When you believe everyone else is making money you do not want to be left out of the party, as that can be lonely and depressing. This is especially the case when you have just had several big losses in a row and you are desperate to turn it all around with one play.
- Lesson 26 - Dealing with Success
- the hardest part about trading is not learning how to read charts or how to analyze white papers or financial statements, but rather managing your own emotions. W
- “Do you feel guilty about your trading success when you see your friends
- struggling
- If it makes you feel better to be generous and take your friends out to dinner once in a while that is fine, but you should by no means feel obligated to do so.
- You are successful because you have put in the time to learn, and have lived through the bad trading days/weeks/months/years to get to where you are now. You owe nothing to anyone else, and all your success is the result of your hard work. Never forget that.
- While these market moves are quite impressive it is important to stay grounded, otherwise you risk over reacting. Monitor your emotions and aim to be neither too high nor too low - stay grounded.”
- Though confidence is not purely an emotion, it does have some emotional elements and they can get you into a lot of trouble.
- be hyper vigilant and follow all your rules closely, otherwise you will make costly mistakes.
- Strict adherence to trading rules. Over confidence can make you sloppy.
- Another sure fire way to get in trouble is to become over-confident to the point of bragging to others about how well you are doing.
- Stop making yourself accountable to others, rather be accountable to yourself and your own goals. Let them live their lives and focus on living your
- Trading is all about survival, so remember the long game and don't get too cocky.
- Trading is all about survival, so remember the long game and don't get too cocky. It has often been said that trading is a marathon and not a sprint, and that is absolutely true
- The market can change a lot faster than you can adapt, so you need to stay focused on surviving no matter what, which means you should be extremely careful, especially when you have been experiencing incredible success.
- Lesson 27 - Don't compare yourself to others
- If you are down and out just remember that it is the bumps and bruises that we acquire along the road of learning that make us stronger
- by following a disciplined rules-based strategy you can avoid those mistakes that make you want to quit, including comparing your results to other traders' results.
- As discussed in the social media lesson, this “guru” who is posting huge profits is probably only showing you the successful trades.
- There is a critical rule that you should never trade or invest any money that you cannot afford to lose. The people you see making huge profits on social media can probably afford to lose most or all of that money, but can you? If they are free to trade and invest without the emotional attachment to that money they are probably making less mistakes than you are.
- When you have to pay rent or your electric bill you are less likely to approach trading as a gambler taking casual risks.
- Full time traders also have the time to watch the charts and follow their trades, whereas a part time trader or hobbyist may be making trades from their phone during a shift a work. This type of casual trading can be dangerous, and unless you are willing to buy and hold I would stay away from it
- There is no way to know what method someone goes through to prepare themselves to trade, as all you are seeing is the end result on twitter that makes you feel bad about yourself in comparison.
- Unless you are working as hard as you can to prepare yourself each day for the new trading session, you will never know if you are working as hard as the person you see posting all those big profits.
- do yourself a favor and ignore other traders' charts
- One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to second guess yourself.
- Lesson 28 - Scale in and scale out
- One bad trade can eliminate 10 good ones. Cut your losers early, and scale in properly to your position rather than at all once.”
- What I recommend doing is taking the total amount you wish to deploy, and then divide that number by 3 or 4.
- Take that first tranche and put it to work where you think a good entry will be, and then sit back and observe for a bit. If the price moves back up the way you expected, and you receive some sort of trend changing confirmation then you can add some more risk. If the price dips down further and you still think it is a good entry, then you can add some more there as well.
- “Buying too early often leads to selling too late.”
- You must strike a balance with how quickly you double down or add a second or third tranche to your position
- It is critically important not to add to your first buy too quickly, because if you do you will be in a much tougher position later should the price drop quickly, as you will now be out of bullets. I recommend waiting for the price to visit a second key level such as an important support area, rather than just doubling down randomly in the middle of the channel.
- “If you scale in to your position rather than FOMO market buying the whole thing, your capitulation point might be your second or third entry. Capitulation is often a great entry point.”
- Lesson 29 - Self punishing
- You can not learn without making mistakes, otherwise there is no lesson to draw upon. There is no shortcut to becoming a good trader.”
- If I can just survive this one bad trade and get back to even, I’ll learn my lesson.” You tell yourself desperately that you will never make the mistake again, all the while you are hating yourself for getting stuck in that position to begin with. Trust me, I have done this myself too many times to count. It happens immediately after making a repeated mistake and watching my position become more and more red with every refresh of the browser.
- Holding onto losing trades in the hope that you “learn your lesson” is common form of self-punishment
- once you emotionally recover from the loss, the same bad planning and desire to gamble will get you right back into trouble again unless you adjust your strategy. I
- It is never a bad decision to take profit off the table, because you are defining your risk and locking up gains.
- one good idea is to leave a small amount of your original position and let it ride.
- Lesson 30 - Trade with confidence
- “Trade with confidence or don't trade at all.”
- If you are confident then you most likely lack fear because you know that your skills will help you to deal with whatever the price action throws at you.
- “Study the chart ahead of time so you are ready no matter what scenario unfolds. Otherwise sit it out.”
- way to improve your confidence is to prepare ahead of time.
- If you are marking all the key price levels on the charts of your favorite plays then you will not get spooked out when volatility arrives
- When you are continually trading from fear and weakness you are bound to make mistakes you would not normally make if you were trading from strength and confidence.
- Desperate to not lose another dollar, you become paralyzed and rather than seize on a good opportunity you hold back out of fear
- In order to play properly you need to have no fear of losing your money as long as the trading plan is solid and provides a good risk/reward setup.
- “Fear of losing money is the #1 reason you are losing money.
- Lesson 31 - Contrarian theory

- The simple formula for long term success is to buy when other people are unhappy about the price.”
- “Clearly we are approaching a short term sentiment bottom - That would suggest to me a relief rally is just around the corner
- you should try to find a way to monitor the sentiment of the market and your feelings when the price is fluctuating wildly. When you see the market participants starting to capitulate in large numbers,
- It is often said that another person's capitulation point is your nut bottom entry.
- “Bottoms/tops can best be measured in sentiment, rather than technicals. As much as it pains me to say so as a chart guy.

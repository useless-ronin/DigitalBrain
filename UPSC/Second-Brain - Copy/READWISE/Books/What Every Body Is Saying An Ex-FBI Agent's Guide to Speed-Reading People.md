- Commandment 5: When you interact with others, try to establish their baseline behaviors
- You need to be able to differentiate between their “normal” face and their “stressed” face.

- Identifying Important Nonverbal Behaviors and Their Meanings
- Once we learn why and how our brain recruits our body to express its emotions nonverbally, we’ll also discover how to interpret these behaviors
- there are three “brains” inside the human skull, each performing specialized functions that work together as the “command-and-control center” that regulates everything our body does.
- we will use our neocortex (our human brain or thinking brain) to analyze critically the limbic reactions of those around us in order to decode what other people are thinking, feeling, or intending
- From simply scratching your head to composing a symphony, there is nothing you do (except for some involuntary muscle reflexes) that is not governed or directed by the brain.
- By this logic, we can use these behaviors to interpret what the brain is choosing to communicate externally.
- limbic brain does not take breaks. It is always “on.”
- the limbic brain is considered the “honest brain” when we think of nonverbals (Goleman, 1995, 13–29).
- This is the brain that can deceive, and it deceives often
- You can use your thoughts to try to disguise your true emotions all you want, but the limbic system will self-regulate and give off clues
- when it comes to revealing honest nonverbal behaviors that help us read people, the limbic system is the holy grail of body language
- freeze, flight, and fight
- freeze, flight, fight.
- Movement attracts attention;
- by immediately holding still upon sensing a threat, the limbic brain caused us to react in the most effective manner possible to ensure our survival.
- Many animals not only freeze their motion when confronted by predators, but some even play dead, which is the ultimate freeze reaction
- Freezing your movement can often make you nearly invisible to others, a phenomenon every soldier and SWAT team operator learns.
- When people feel threatened or exposed, they react just like our ancestors did a million years earlier; they freeze.
- When suddenly caught in a potentially dangerous circumstance, we immediately freeze before taking action

## Highlights
- You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat

- States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers or philosophers become rulers.
- Marcus, the ruler of the Roman Empire for almost two decades and author of the immortal Meditations
- He would have claimed to be, at best, a diligent student and a very imperfect practitioner of a philosophy developed by others.
- he was a serious child, but also that he loved boxing, wrestling, running and falconry, that he was a good ballplayer and that he loved to hunt.
- The first book of the Meditations pays tribute to a number of philosophers from whom Marcus learned, both formally and informally, and he is likely to have studied with or listened to many others.
- There is no evidence that Marcus experienced anything like the “conversion” to philosophy that some ancient figures experienced (or affected), but it is clear that by the middle to late 140s philosophy was becoming increasingly central to his life.
- What kind of ruler did this philosopher-king prove to be? Not, perhaps, as different from his predecessors as one might have expected. Though an emperor was all-powerful in theory, his ability to control policy was in reality much more limited. Much of his time was spent fielding problems that had moved up the administrative ladder: receiving embassies from the large cities of the empire, trying appeals of criminal cases, answering queries from provincial governors and dealing with petitions from individuals

- just because you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don’t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others
- Why are we here? How should we live our lives? How can we ensure that we do what is right? How can we protect ourselves against the stresses and pressures of daily life? How should we deal with pain and misfortune? How can we live with the knowledge that someday we will no longer exist? It would be both pointless and impertinent
- The discipline of perception requires that we maintain absolute objectivity of thought: that we see things dispassionately for what they are
- Marcus himself more than once compares the world ruled by logos to a city in which all human beings are citizens
- As human beings we are part of nature, and our duty is to accommodate ourselves to its demands and requirements—“to live as nature requires,” as Marcus often puts i
- Our duty to act justly does not mean that we must treat others as our equals; it means that we must treat them as they deserve.
- we must see things for what they are (here the discipline of perception is relevant) and accept them, by exercising the discipline of will, or what Epictetus calls (in a phrase quoted by Marcus) “the art of acquiescence.”
- Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:
  • to accept this event with humility [will];
  • to treat this person as he should be treated [action];
  • to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in [perception].
- As for humans, our role is simply to live as best we can, making the most of what pleasures are available to us and insulating ourselves as far as possible from pain and anxiety
- The MEDITATIONS: Genre, Structure, and Style
- Not only was it not written for publication, but Marcus clearly had no expectation that anyone but himself would ever read it.
- Death is not to be feared, Marcus continually reminds himself. It is a natural process, part of the continual change that forms the world
- Soon you will be dead,” Marcus tells himself on a number of occasions, “and none of it will matter
- All things change or pass away, perish and are forgotten
- Marcus may have been a Stoic, but he was also a Roman, influenced not only by Zeno and Chrysippus but by Homer and Vergil

## Highlights
- peak experiences,” since they represent the high moments of life where we joyfully find ourselves catapulted beyond the confines of the mundane and ordinary.
- Who are we
- What is the nature of the Universe in which we live
- Our answers to these questions dictate the quality and characteristics of our personal relationships with family, friends and employers/employees. When considered on a larger scale, they define societies
- MYTH #1 Humanity has reached the pinnacle of its development
- First step: to recognize they exist. Most people do not.
- MYTH #2 We are completely separate from each other, nature, and the Kosmos.
- This myth of “other-than-me” has been responsible for wars, the rape of the planet, and all forms and expressions of human injustice
- thoughts, attitudes, and healing intentions of one individual can influence the physiology of another person
- Now this can't happen according to the known principles of physics and world view of traditional science. Yet the preponderance of evidence suggests that indeed it does.
- MYTH #3 The physical world is all there is.
- science assumes that anything that cannot be measured, tested in a laboratory, or probed by the five senses or their technological extensions simply doesn't exist. Ifs “not real.”
- the influential, pioneering individuals I spoke with felt that we have not reached the pinnacle of human development, we are connected, rather than separate, from all of life, and that the full spectrum of consciousness encompasses both physical and a multitude of nonphysical dimensions of reality.
- the problem of humanity is deeply rooted in the mind itself. Or rather, our misidentification with mind
- Our drifting awareness, our tendency to take the path of least resistance by being less than fully awake to the present moment, creates a void
- Seldom do we find ourselves resting in the oceanic depth of the here and now. For it is here in the Now where we find our True Self, which lies behind our physical body, shifting emotions, and chattering mind.
- Our ultimate destiny is to re- connect with our essential Being and express from our extraordinary, divine reality in the ordinary physical world, moment by moment. Easy to say, yet rare are those who have attained the further reaches of human development.
- A battery of scientists can get together and tell you about all the scientific proof for the fact that bananas are bitter. But all you have to do is taste one, once, to realize that there is this whole other aspect to bananas
- Ultimately, proof lies not in intellectual arguments, but in being touched in some way by the sacred within and without.
- You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are!
- THE ORIGIN OF THIS BOOK
- I have little use for the past and rarely think about it
- The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my own existence. What was the point m continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence, was now becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to continue to
- I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was. "Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me:
- what everybody was looking for had already happened to me.
- This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy
- I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in a state of the most intense joy.
- t intense joy.
  But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More fundamental, perhaps, than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has never left me since then
- people would occasionally come up to me and say: “I want what you have. Can you give it to me, or show me how to get it?” And I would say: “You have it already. You just can't feel it because your mind is making too much noise.”
- The Power of Now
- THE TRUTH THAT IS WITHIN YOU
- was. “Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the 'I' and the 'self' that 'I' cannot live with.
- is possible that at a later time, the seed that was sown when reading this book will merge with the seed of enlightenment that each human being carries within, and suddenly that seed will sprout and come alive within them.
- I draw your attention to what is false in you. I speak of the nature of human unconsciousness and dysfunction as well as its most common behavioral manifestations, from conflict in relationships to warfare between tribes or nations
- You are shown how to free yourself from enslavement to the mind, enter into this enlightened state of consciousness and sustain it in everyday life.
- Until you are able to experience what I speak of, you may find those passages somewhat repetitive
- The pause symbol ¤ after certain passages is a suggestion that you may want to stop reading for a moment, become still, and feel and experience the truth of what has just been said. T
- Don't read with the mind only. Watch out for any “feeling-response” as you read and a sense of recognition from deep within
- within. I cannot tell you any spiritual truth that deep within you don't know already. All I can do is remind you of what you have forgotten. Living knowledge, ancient and yet ever new, is then activated and released from within every cell of your body.
- Don't get attached to any words. They are only stepping stones, to be left behind as quickly as possible.
- When I quote from the ancient religions or other teachings, it is to reveal their deeper meaning and thereby restore their transformative power particularly for those readers who are followers of these religions or teachings. I say to them: there is no need to go elsewhere for the truth. Let me show you how to go more deeply into what you already have.
  Mostly, however, I have endeavored to use terminology
- Chapter One
- YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND
- THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO ENLIGHTENMENT
- I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer, inside yourself.
- Those who have not found their true wealth, which is the radiant joy of Being and the deep, unshakable peace that comes with it, are beggars, even if they have great material wealth
- it is simply your natural state of felt oneness with Being
- It is a state of connectedness with something immeasurable and indestructible, something that, almost paradoxically, is essentially you and yet is much greater than you
- It is finding your true nature beyond name and form. The inability to feel this connectedness gives rise to the illusion of separation, from yourself and from the world around you
- Buddha's simple definition of enlightenment as “the end of suffering
- Despite this precaution, the majority of Buddhists still believe that enlightenment is for the Buddha, not for them, at least not in this lifetime.
- But don't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind is still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of “feeling- realization” is enlightenment.
- The word Being explains nothing, but nor does God.
- Being, however, has the advantage that it is an open concept. It does not reduce the infinite invisible to a finite entity

- FREEING YOURSELF FROM YOUR MIND
- What exactly do you mean by “watching the thinker”?
- virtually everyone hears a voice, or several voices, in their head all the time: the involuntary thought processes that you don't realize you have the power to stop.
- You have probably come across “mad” people in the street incessantly talking or muttering to themselves. Well, thats not much different from what you and all other “normal” people do, except that you don't do it out loud
- it may be reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future situations
- it often imagines things going wrong and negative outcomes; this is called worry.
- you see and judge the present through the eyes of the past and get a totally distorted view of it
- you can free yourself from your mind.
- Start listening to the voice in your head as often as you can.
- Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought patterns, those old gramophone records that have been playing in your head perhaps for many years
- listen to the voice in your head, be there as the witnessing presence
- Do not judge or condemn what you hear, for doing so would mean that the same voice has come in again through the back door.
- This I am realization, this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. It arises from beyond the mind.
- So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. A new dimension of consciousness has come in. As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence your deeper self behind or underneath the thought, as it were
- When these gaps occur, you feel a certain stillness and peace inside you.
- there is no end to its depth. You will also feel a subtle emanation of joy arising from deep within: the joy of Being.

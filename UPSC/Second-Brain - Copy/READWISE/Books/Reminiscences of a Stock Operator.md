- My plan of trading was sound enough and won oftener than it lost.
- What beat me was not having brains enough to stick to my own game—that is, to play the market only when I was satisfied that precedents favored my play
- There is a time for all things, but I didn’t know it
- There is the plain fool, who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere, but there is the Wall Street fool, who thinks he must trade all the time.
- No man can always have adequate reasons for buying or selling stocks daily—or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play.
- I did not know then what I learned later, what made me fifteen years later, wait two long weeks and see a stock on which I was very bullish go up thirty points before I felt that it was safe to buy it.
- either. A stock operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies within himself.
- I was a pretty active trader and had a sort of reputation as a winner. I guess my commissions amounted to something. I ran up my account quite a little, but, of course, in the end I lost. I played carefully; but I had to lose. I’ll tell you the reason: it was my remarkable success in the bucket shops!

## Highlights
- I could scalp successfully, because I could move like lightning.
- I never lose my temper over the stock market. I never argue with the tape. Getting sore at the market doesn’t get you anywhere.
- knew there wasn’t anything wrong with me; only with my play
- In two days I made twenty-eight hundred dollars, and I was hoping they’d let me finish the week out.
- said. “I’ve heard all about yeh. I make my money coppering suckers’ bets, and yeh don’t belong here.
- They get wise mighty quick when they’re losing and I did want to buy one thousand B. R. T.
- there was more to the game of stock speculation than I had considered before I went to Fullerton’s office to trade

- how much some of their customers made—you’d have sworn it was a regular broker who actually bought and sold your stocks on the Exchange—and how if a man only traded heavy he could make enough to satisfy anybody.
- If it hadn’t been for their refusing to take my business I never would have stopped trading in them. And then I never would have learned that there was much more to the game of stock speculation than to play for fluctuations of a few points.
- They say there are two sides to everything. But there is only one side to the stock market; and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side.
- My losses have taught me that I must not begin to advance until I am sure I shall not have to retreat
- if I cannot advance I do not move at all.
- I do not mean by this that a man should not limit his losses when he is wrong. He should. But that should not breed indecision.
- in losing money I have gained experience and accumulated a lot of valuable don’ts
- I always knew I would have another chance and that I would not make the same mistake a second time. I believed in myself.
- A man must believe in himself and his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game. That is why I don’t believe in tips
- If I buy stocks on Smith’s tip I must sell those same stocks on Smith’s tip. I am depending on him. Suppose Smith is away on a holiday when the selling time comes around? No, sir, nobody can make big money on what someone else tells him to do.
- It took me five years to learn to play the game intelligently enough to make big money when I was right
- the way I lost money is the way everybody loses money who loses money in Wall Street
- Speculation is a hard and trying business, and a speculator must be on the job all the time or he’ll soon have no job to be on.
- To look at speculation from another angle.
- when I am wrong only one thing convinces me of it, and that is, to lose money. And I am only right when I make money. That is speculating.
- I quit eleven hundred dollars minus for the day.
- It didn’t worry me, because I couldn’t see where there was anything wrong with me
- the unusual never happened there would be no difference in people and then there wouldn’t be any fun in life. The game would become merely a matter of addition and subtraction
- It’s the guessing that develops a man’s brain power. Just consider what you have to do to guess right.
- The market was not going to drop right through to China. So I decided instantly to cover my shorts and go long.
- I was accustomed to regarding the tape as the best little friend I had because I bet according to what it told me. But this time the tape double-crossed me
- The divergence between the printed and the actual prices undid me.
- It seems so obvious now that tape reading is not enough, irrespective of the brokers’ execution, that I wonder why I didn’t then see both my trouble and the remedy for it.
- You see, I never could trade with a limit. I must take my chances with the market. That is what I am trying to beat—the market, not the particular price.
- When I think I should sell, I sell. When I think stocks will go up, I buy

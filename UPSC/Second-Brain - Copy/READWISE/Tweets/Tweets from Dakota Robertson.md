## Highlights
- I went on a date with a woman a few months ago...
  She was paying 60K/year to get a writing degree.
  It's a 6 year program.
  And no job after graduation.
  You could fuck up for 6 years straight in entrepreneurship and it'd be less risky than university. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/WrongsToWrite/status/1560216694236319747))

## Highlights
- 1. Write a blog post
  2. Send it to your email list
  3. Turn it into a Twitter thread
  4. Turn that into a long LinkedIn post
  5. Pull 7 smaller nuggets out of it
  6. Turn those into short-form posts
  7. Post those throughout the week
  That's how you turn 1 piece of content into 20. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimStodz/status/1533777750267506691))
- Whatever you're doing in life, I recommend:
  - Starting a blog
  - Writing at least one post per week
  - Starting 1-3 social media pages
  - Posting on them daily
  This doesn't take much time, and if you don't do it, you'll probably wish you did.
  Start today. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TimStodz/status/1533474005914615808))

## Highlights
- #TaTip
  Don't short strength; short weakness
  Don't buy weakness; buy strength
  The key is being able to identify the shift in strength/weakness early on and catch a portion of the move
  You don't need to short the top or buy the bottom and you don't need to catch the whole move ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nebraskangooner/status/1540806894255611905))
- #TaTip
  Learn how to analyze charts.
  Define key levels.
  Understand what will happen if those key levels are respected or breach.
  React accordingly without emotion or bias and always be most focused on your potential risk with each action you make. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nebraskangooner/status/1536360444637716481))
- Acknowledging that you have no idea what is going to happen next is good for trading.
  It's impossible to know what happens next at all times.
  In times of uncertainty it's best to take less risks. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nebraskangooner/status/1532462222525489163))
- Technical analysis is a lot easier if you don't overcomplicate it. 
  The more simple I've let my analysis be the more accurate I feel like it's become.
  But it wasn't without a lot of studying and a strong understanding of the fundamentals. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nebraskangooner/status/1525444411454373896))

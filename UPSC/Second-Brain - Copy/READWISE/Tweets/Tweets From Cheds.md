- “When given a choice between a reversal and continuation play, take the continuation play every time. Go with the trend.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigCheds/status/1528405057519112195))
- All those alt coins you wanted to short yesterday are now bouncing, and now you are thinking about going long. Stop chasing your tail and pick a move to fade. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigCheds/status/1521951519008043015))
- Counter trading the herd works well but it has the be the right environment and against the trend. In an uptrend when people are overly bearish that's when you fade the consensus.
  In a downtrend like now the reason people are bearish is because the trend is bearish. ✍️

- A downtrend doesn’t care if you call it a bear market or bull market or even if you can recognize it - it’s going to trend until volume/volatility change it

- Most people just want to have their bias confirmed and worries soothed that’s why they spend more time looking at chats than charts. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BigCheds/status/1513199468186902531))

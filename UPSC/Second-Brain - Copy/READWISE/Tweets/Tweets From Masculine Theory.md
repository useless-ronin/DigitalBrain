## Highlights
- It's funny hearing people arguing about simulation theory.
  Look around you - what do you see?
  - Fast food
  - Porn
  - Video games
  Here's what I see:
  - Artificial food
  - Artificial sexual experiences
  - Artificial adventures
  The simulation is already here.
  Unplug yourselves. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MasculineTheory/status/1410673610260426756))

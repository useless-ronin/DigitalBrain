## Highlights
- 1. Invest your money rather than save.
- Governments print money to fight recessions, and fund wars. When they do, they take away the purchasing power of the money you have earned.
- 3. Lose all of your money.
- Start a business with your family. Choose a marketplace to sell on. Import goods from China. Buy low and sell high. Let the business become huge. Bring on investors and see that they are like having a boss whip you with a whip.
- 2. Understand the idea of purchasing power.
- Have money allow you to buy back your time, instead of spending money on things that create a never-ending trail of debt. Make the acquisition of wealth secondary. Focus on how you can be helpful. Get excited by all the people you can meet and do life with.
- 4. Become a content creator.
- Learn to make a difference rather than a profit.
- Content creators are part of one of the biggest wealth transfers in history. Everything is content. Storytelling through words, videos, audio, photography and illustrations is a booming business.

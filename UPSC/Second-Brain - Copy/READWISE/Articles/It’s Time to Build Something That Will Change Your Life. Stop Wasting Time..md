# Highlights 
You’re literally dying to build something.  ^278320134

---

. A creator is simply a person who builds something online. All of us have it inside of us to do it.  ^278320135

---

He says every creator leaves behind two graves when they die.  ^278320136

---

One grave contains the skin, bone, organs, and hair leftover from your body that will slowly decompose in the ground to eventually become at one with the soil. The second grave holds all of the ideas you never got to release.  ^278320137

---

Some of the smartest people are in the cemetery. They were geniuses but we never got to know because their ideas were buried in their second grave. It’s why I’m so crazy about writing online.  ^278320138

---

I want my second grave to be empty when I leave this earth.  ^278320139

---

Your ideas have enormous power. They contain life lessons, moments of enormous creativity, strategies, and helpful inspiration that can get someone out of a dark place.  ^278320140

---

When you build something it changes your life  ^278320141

---

Creative endeavors don’t reveal their awesomeness until long after they’re released into the world.  ^278320142

---

Helping other people with their problems changed my life, although it wasn’t obvious.The act of creation rewires your thinking. It shifts your mind into creation rather than the default mode of consumption.  ^278320143

---

Creation gives meaning to your life. It takes everything you consume and all the ideas bubbling around in your head and makes them all worthwhile.  ^278320144

---

You think you need more information  ^278320145

---

You’re never ready. It feels like there is always more to know.  ^278320146

---

“No point building now. The quality of my work will be too low,  ^278320147

---

There’s only so long you can consume everybody else’s learning. Eventually, it will feel empty.  ^278320148

---

You can live through someone else’s eyes, or let your eyes witness the gorgeous miracle of having deeply personal experiences.  ^278320149

---

The trick is to, first, admit your fear to yourself. Then admit your fear to another person  ^278320150

---

Feel the fear and do it anyway, as the cliche goes.  ^278320151

---

Once you know you’re not alone with the feeling of fear it normalizes it.  ^278320152

---

Acknowledge your errors and then omit them in the future.Take mistakes and use them as opportunities to build better next time.  ^278320153

---

The internet contains infinite leverage. You can build anything you can imagine without too many constraints.  ^278320154

---

The sooner you start to build, the sooner you can start to get results  ^278320155

---

If you’re not excited, then get excited. This is the best time in history to be a creator. Stop wasting your time on Netflix. Stop engaging in toxic conversations and being a serial social media commenter. Stop speculating. Stop with the excuses. Stop with waiting for the perfect time.  ^278320156

---

The trouble is, you think you have time.  ^278320157

---

Life is short. Start to build something today that will soon change your life in bizarre ways you could never predict.  ^278320158

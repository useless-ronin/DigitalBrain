Old School Leverage: Costly and Permission Required  ^278319400

---

labor leverage and capital leverage.  ^278319401

---

Labor leverage is: other humans working for you.  ^278319402

Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You’re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob.  ^278319403

---

Capital Leverage  ^278319404

---

Money is good as a form of leverage. It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money  ^278319405

---

It’s more modern and is the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century.  ^278319406

---

It scales very, very well, and if you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people  ^278319407

---

New School Leverage: No Marginal Cost of Replication and Permissionless  ^278319408

idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage.  ^278319409

It started with the printing press.  ^278319410

---

it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.  ^278319411

---

They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing—these kinds of things are permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to do them, and that’s why they are very egalitarian.  ^278319412

---

All you need is a computer—you don’t need anyone’s permission  ^278319413

---

Stack Your Leverage  ^278319414

---

A leveraged worker can out-produce a non-leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand.  ^278319415

---

judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.  ^278319416

---

Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is the current shiny flashy thing.  ^278319417

---

If your curiosity ever leads you to a place where society eventually wants to go, you’ll get paid extremely well.  ^278319418

---

pay it forward whenever you have a chance.  ^278319419

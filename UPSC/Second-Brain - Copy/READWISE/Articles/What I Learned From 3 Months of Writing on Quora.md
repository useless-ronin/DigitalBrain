# Highlights 
I’ve felt like an absolute crazy person for publishing on Quora every single day  ^278699041

---

No matter what I tried or how much I wrote, I couldn’t get noticed on Quora.  ^278699042

---

These are all of the mistakes, lessons, and improvements that I’ve made during my first 3 months of writing a Quora answer every single day  ^278699043

---

Stop “writing content” and start telling stories  ^278699044

---

The secret to how I post every single day seems like cheating. I do write every day, but I don’t necessarily write a new Quora answer every day.  ^278699045

---

it’s not quantity that wins on Quora (or any other writing site), it’s quality.  ^278699046

---

You have to write good articles, tell good stories, and write answers that make people feel something, learn something, and want to know more about you.  ^278699047

---

Ancient writing advice holds true here: show, don’t tell.  ^278699048

---

The perfect writing is imperfect  ^278699049

---

I’ve struggled with perfectionism for most of my life, and my “volume-based” approach to writing is actually an effort to correct those perfectionist tendencies.  ^278699050

---

Art (writing) is just how I manifest that teaching.  ^278699051

---

Good content on Quora is an exploration into your lived experience, imperfections, and triumphs.  ^278699052

---

Most people are more qualified than you. Get over it.  ^278699053

---

Who am I, as a 24-year-old Jiu-Jitsu fighter with a tiny little Medium blog, to say anything about anything?  ^278699054

---

But it’s that mindset that stalls all creative progress. Telling myself that I “don’t have what it takes” is the best way to make sure that I never have what it takes.  ^278699055

---

Credibility is built, it doesn’t appear magically in front of you. All fingers point to “start writing right now” as the solution to solving your lack of qualification problem  ^278699056

---

How I really went viral on Quora  ^278699057

---

I’ve made up for a lack of experience with an increased amount of output.  ^278699058

---

Doing this didn’t make me that much better of a writer, but it did give me more opportunities to spin the wheel of virality on the internet.  ^278699059

---

The reason that it went viral was that it was a decent piece of content, with a good image attached, and it was put in the right place on the website.  ^278699060

---

I learned how to better play the Quora game by playing it more than most people.  ^278699061

---

Not bad for something that took me 5 minutes.  ^278699062

---

Learning how to blend your stories within the platforms that you’re writing on is an art within itself, and to me, it’s what makes writing online fun and exciting.  ^278699063

---

If you throw 100 of your best pieces of content at the internet wheel of virality, you never know what’s going to take off.  ^278699064

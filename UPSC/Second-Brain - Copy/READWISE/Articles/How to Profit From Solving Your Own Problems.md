- People are interested in more than one thing.
- The creator economy is impossible to saturate, otherwise it’s not the creator economy (one-person businesses).
- If you want to build a billion-dollar company, then yes stick to one thing, but that’s not what I want… and I would argue 99% of people don’t actually want that.

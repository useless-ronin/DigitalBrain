- We are creating a future of passionate individuals that produce world-shifting creations.
- I. The Paradox Of Productivity
- “The clever man may work smarter, not harder, they say, but the creative man doesn’t work at all.” — Alex Soojung-Kim Pang
- Imagine going to the gym for 8 hours trying to be as “productive” as possible.
- Would you be able to come back and give it your all the next day? How about 5 days in a row? Would you be able to tough it out until you can use your paid vacation time to recover and do it all over again?
- Your body would be decimated.
- we go to the gym for 45-90 minutes at a time
- Intensity isn’t sustainable. It’s not rocket science. Sustainability, consistency, and creativity must be prioritized before we even mention the word “productivity.”
- II. The Fill – Empty – Use Framework For Sustainable Productivity & Creativity

## Highlights
- Drucker isn’t just talking about 50x productivity for the smartest people. He’s talking about 50x productivity on average for an entire society. It’s profound historically. It’s profound personally. It’s profound societally.
	- “The most important, and indeed the truly unique, contribution of management in the 20th century was the fifty-fold increase in the productivity of the manual worker in manufacturing.”
		- Imagine if you could do an entire week’s work in less than an hour? Or imagine if you could work a full work week, but got 50x the results of everyone else
			- **If productivity drops for too long, revolutions happen**
				- **If productivity goes up, the system stays because workers enjoy higher incomes and more leisure time.**
- “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”
- **A single employee with a laptop can do more than a roomful of people from the 1960s. Yet, we aren’t seeing this in the productivity data.**
- **How is it that we make one of the most significant shifts in history and don’t see big, undeniable results from it?**
- This surprising phenomenon is known as the **productivity paradox.**
- There are hundreds of millions of pages on the Internet that mention productivity. In fact, there is a whole cottage industry of articles, books, and videos on productivity by productivity gurus.Yet, most people into productivity (including myself) had never heard of the most important breakthrough in the history of productivity or the person behind it.
- It’s like collectively learning a philosophy (scientific method) or discovering a technology (steam engine) that changes everything and then removing it from the history books and subsequently forgetting about it.
- Naively, I thought I would find an answer quickly and write an article about it. But, as I dove deeper into the literature on knowledge work productivity, I realized that the topic was still unsolved.
- “At the peak of his celebrity in the early twentieth century, Taylor gave lectures around the country and was as famous as Edison or Ford.”—Robert Kanigel
- “My head was full of wonderful and great projects to simplify the processes, to design new machinery, to revolutionize the methods of the whole establishment.”
- this I feel I can accomplish much more than I could in any other way, because it has been practically my life’s work; and I also think it is my duty to devote my time and money to this cause, for the reason that there is no one else in the country who is in a position to accomplish what I am able to do in this direction.
- himself, wrote that **the principles of scientific management “can be applied with equal force to all social activities: to the management of our homes; the management of our farms; the management of the business of our tradesmen, large and small; of our churches, our philanthropic institutions, our universities, and our governmental departments.”**
- he even applied the principles to become a world-class tennis and golf player (he won the national doubles championship in 1881).
- One life was spent working 10–11 hours a day on the shop floor. The other was spent playing tennis and golf at country clubs while also “studying physics and mathematics at home, singing in choral groups,” among other activities.
- 1898, Taylor was hired by Bethlehem Steel to make its 600 shovelers more productive. So, he endeavored to create a science of shoveling.
- The output per man doubled. As a result, employees earned 35% more on average while the company paid significantly less.All of this from turning the simple act of shoveling into a science.
- When reading about the drastic improvements in shoveling, bricklaying, and assembly, my mind was boggled. I didn’t understand how fields that had been around for thousands of years could be improved so easily and drastically — not by complex theories but by a simple process anyone could replicate. Taylor’s book shed light on the peculiarity
- **What We Have Been Taught About Productivity Is Fundamentally Wrong**
- Overall, **I was left with the impression that the cause of the productivity boost was technology.**
- Technology is not the fundamental cause of productivity. Simply mastering the latest and greatest tools will not take you to the promised land of productivity — despite many headlines on social media promising it.
- What history shows us is that what really matters is first having the right production process — the steps you follow to create good or service. Then, technology boosts the power of that process.
- **the production process is the fire. The technology is the gasoline that accelerates the fire.**
- **Finding quick hacks using the latest tools while using an unoptimized process is shallow productivity. It is like putting lipstick on a pig.**
- Let’s do a simple thought experiment. Let’s go through the average day of a knowledge worker and think about all of the tasks they perform:
- **Prioritize the day with a to do list**
- Exercise their craft
- Communicate with others (emails, meetings, memos, proposals)Make decisionsSolve problemsLearnTeachInnovateEtc.
- Task Breakdown. **Are most people aware that the knowledge work skills above even exist — let alone breaking them down into their individual micro-tasks?**
- **Measurement how long each task takes.** Do most people track their time? If so, are they tracking their micro-tasks?
- Experiment to find the one best way. Are people simply using good-enough rules of thumb or are they using the scientific method to find the optimal approach?
- **Train for standardization. Once the optimal approach has been figured out, are most people being trained in them?**
- Most knowledge workers are winging it or using a best practice from their specific boss, company, or job rather than using the most scientifically tested approach
- **there is no science on the ideal load for information consumption**
- **Today’s knowledge workers waste a third of their day, every day, on activities that could be reduced, consolidated, or eliminated altogether.**
- it’s incredibly surprising to realize that knowledge work is still in its infancy and is using almost none of the proven techniques used during the most rapid productivity boom in human history. It’s mind-boggling in the same way that it is mind-boggling that suitcase wheels weren’t standard until the 1980s.
- What I now understand is that Taylor didn’t just introduce a new process for manual work. He introduced a universal productivity paradigm…
- **Productivity doesn’t make us a machine.** One of the main reasons science has progressed so far is tools that help us get finer grain, objective perspectives on reality than our senses can. I now understand how timing myself and building a granular, objective map of my thought/action process can augment my humanness rather than stunting it.
- **Productivity is good**. There is a cottage industry of writers who shoot down the frivolity of productivity. But, now I see that increasing society’s average productivity means fewer revolutions, less cultural warfare, less environmental waste, and higher quality of life (more leisure, better healthcare, etc). These are big deals. I now think society under-focuses on productivity.
- ***Small productivity gains aren’t frivolous. Amazing productivity gains come from small hacks, which individually seem frivolous, but together add up to mind-boggling change.*** **Just like the microscope unveiled entire universes of organisms (viruses, germs) and matter (quarks, atoms), finer attention to detail opens a whole new world of productivity.**
- Knowledge work productivity can be 50x’d. Knowledge work is still in its infancy. This means that the potential gains we can have with the existing tools may be much larger than anyone thinks.
- **The more efficient we are at work individually and collectively, the more time we have to carve out for slow, deep living not based on optimization**
- ***It’s worth each of us individually spending hundreds (if not thousands) of hours improving our productivity.***

## Highlights
- Realistic time management.
- have a system that works around my brain, and subverts any tendencies to procrastinate — especially during periods of extreme willpower depletion.
- work directly from a calendar, not a To-Do list.
- felt good to run a line through things as I got them done, but sadly, I never really got as many done in a day as I should — or could have.
- Some tasks take longer than others, but all tasks look the same in a list. Seeing them in a calendar gives you a more realistic idea of how long tasks will take to get done.
- start plugging them into your calendar to give you an actual idea of how much time you have to do them
- The dreamers are the ones who have poor ability to predict how long something will actually take, and show up late to things, miss deadlines and generally end up having all your work snowball into Friday afternoon.
- If you have repeating tasks each week, as I do, you’ll be able to copy and paste entire series’ of repeating tasks that accurately reflect the time it takes to do them
- For tasks, you’re doing for the first time (or larger tasks broken into smaller tasks) allow for Parkinson’s Law: ie. figure out how long you think it will take, then double it. It’s much better to have slack than to try and borrow time from other tasks
- Trick #2: Colour code your calendar.
- Trick #3: Know how long to block distractions.
- Trick #4: Bundle similar jobs or ‘mindsets’.

- It kicked their brains into gear, knowing they didn’t have all day and night to get their work done. The same applies here — twofold:
- You know you only have a certain amount of time to get the job done, be it from a self-imposed or externally-imposed deadline
- If you know you’ve got a bunch of admin (emails, invoicing, QuickBooks, blog posts etc.) and you know it’ll be basically the same mindset and toolset for all of them, block those tasks together
- Trick #5: Having an end time/date forces you to get it done.
- If they’re high priority tasks, shift them to earlier in the day so you give them your full attention. Your energy and willpower wain throughout the day, so be sure to get your M.I.T. done first thing, before anything else.
- Professionals stick to the schedule. Amateurs let life get in the way.
- You don’t wonder
- It’s a good practice to have a small reward at the end of each task, or at the very least a moment of mindfulness and awareness of the accomplishment, so you do feel a reward at the completion of each task
- You don’t sit around wondering what to do next because your calendar is telling you exactly what you should be doing and how long it should take
- Ploughing through items mindlessly is not the point of the above exercise. Enjoy the process.
- One key element to making this work is: Make sure your calendar is visible somewhere on your workspace: whether it’s a second screen, a smaller floating window or similar;
- Keep your calendar visible at all times.

# Highlights 
Nothing adds depth and meaning to a story like symbolism. It acts as webbing between theme and story. Themes alone can sound preachy, and stories alone can sound shallow. Symbolism weaves the two together.  ^278319202

---

Symbolism can also achieve the same results as several sentences of explicit imagery.  ^278319203

---

If a picture is worth a thousand words, a symbol is worth ten-thousand.  ^278319204

---

There is no right way to symbolize. There are poor approaches, but there are no Symbol Police. You won’t get arrested for using or abusing a symbol. Experiment!  ^278319205

---

Creating symbols requires patience, practice, and precision. Recognizing symbols takes time, but it is worth the effort. Don’t force symbolism in. If it doesn’t come naturally, wait until your second or third draft. Until you know the theme(s) of the story, your best symbols are yet to come.  ^278319206

Write using at least one symbol. Give yourself fifteen minutes to start and feel free to get carried away.  ^278319207

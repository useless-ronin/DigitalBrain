## Highlights
- All I know is that I was a silent observer. Everywhere we went, I paid close attention to people’s actions. Not in a judgemental way, but in a discerning way.
- One of them was the conventional career path. Go to school.
- A “secure” future didn’t sound so secure.
- The Future Career Path
- The future of work will not be work. It will be play.
- The human psyche is wired for survival. Entrepreneurship is modern-day survival.
- We cannot control human evolution. The path is already laid out and it is unfolding rapidly before our eyes. Those that hop on the train will survive and others will experience neurobiological decay
- Pursuing your curiosity, making discoveries, and being able to maintain that lifestyle in a world that is shifting from corporation to individual.
- Tapping into your creative genius, creating solutions to problems, condensing information, and raising the well-being of the collective.
- Pursuing Your Curiosity
- culture is designed to strip our child-like curiosity away from us. This is a blessing and a curse. A blessing for those that realize it, a curse for those that don’t.
- Curiosity is the path to doing the things you want to do — not the things that others want you to do
- You pursue your curiosity by questioning instead of coping.
- Luckily, we live in a world where anything is monetizable. If you know how to learn fast, build an offer, and sell — you can build distribution just by talking, learning, and teaching about your curiosities online.
- The Medium & The Message
- Creators, personal brands, “thought leaders,” and online educators are increasing the rate of evolution at an exponential rate.
- We can learn more, act faster, make new discoveries, and pass down our own lessons in the same manner
- argue this is the meaning of life and some people are sitting on the sidelines as others are building massive leverage for their future
- All while pursuing their unique curiosities that would allow everyone to go in a unique, unsaturated direction in business.
- They imitate for survival. We imitated our parents, teachers, and friends in order to learn how to function in the world
- 1) Media (The Message)
- That is how you attract an audience, learn in public, and distribute your condensed zip-file-like knowledge that you can sell (while simultaneously accelerating evolution and raising the collective well-being).
- To master media, study marketing, persuasion, sales, psychology, epistemology, philosophy, and everything else that allows you to understand the mind
- Start a social media account based on your curiosities. Create videos, podcasts, articles, posts, and the rest. Treat it like a hobby, a game where you are learning what makes other human beings tick.
- 2) Code (The Medium)
- you can learn to code and get a job in ~6 months without a degree, make a good amount of money, and then transition into whatever you would like.
- 3) The Brutal Combo
- no-code tools are popping up out of nowhere. Anyone can build a website, email list, blog, product, membership, community, and other things that allow them to harness their media skills online.
- the average individual will learn both media and code by just starting a personal brand.
- Build Distribution, Then Build Whatever You Want
- An audience is traffic. An email list is traffic. Communities are traffic. Your network is traffic. All can be sent to your digital product or service.
- Distribution is just a fancy way of saying potential traffic.
- Everyone can pursue their curiosity and do what they love — if they realize this opportunity.
- “There are almost 7B people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7B companies.” — Naval
- Media is the information (content). Code is the real estate (where content is housed). Brand is distribution (how you attract people to your content). By building these digital assets, you can create a system-based digital product or service (that condenses information, which is valuable) and talk about your expertise from the lens of your curiosities (so there is no “competition”).
- Making A Fortune
- 1) Done For You
- 2) Done With You
- Someone has a problem, you have a unique system for solving that, they hire you, and you solve the problem for them.
- services are things like consulting, coaching, or mentoring.
- Rather than doing something for someone, you are walking them through your system.
- 3) Do It Yourself
- for digital products. You package up your system in a digestible way via no-code tools and distribute it infinitely via the internet.
- By working your way up the ladder, developing your system, packaging it up, and distributing it with “no marginal cost of replication

## Highlights
- Inward momentum: Taking a pre-built audience and pulling them inward into a new platform.
  Compound attention: Having those people interact on one piece of content.
  Outward momentum: Using that compound attention to push it outward to new people on a new platform.
- I'm simply leveraging the inward momentum of pulling in my pre-built audience, and then turning that into outward momentum from the compounding on Twitter to grow and collect new emails and followers.

## Highlights
- Our brains also unconsciously bend our perception of reality to meet our desires or expectations. And they fill in gaps using our past experiences.
- How do we know what’s real?
- illusions give us the chance to reveal how they work. And how do they work? Well, as the owner of a human brain, I have to say it’s making me a little uneasy.
- “It’s really important to understand we’re not seeing reality
- our experience of reality is not perfect
- “We’re seeing a story that’s being created for us.”
- It’s not about doubting everything that comes through our senses. It’s about looking for our blind spots, with the goal of becoming better thinkers
- regular meditation practice is associated with increased compassion
- One possibility is that the illusion is generated in the visual cortex. Located at the back of your head, this is the part of your brain that directly processes the information coming from your eyes
- brain is telling us stories about the smallest things we perceive, like the motion of objects. But it also tells us stories about some of the most complex things we think about, creating assumptions about people based on race, among other social prejudices.
- Vision is a vastly complex system involving around 30 areas of the brain. There are other illusions that do seem to “fool” the visual cortex, because no story about the brain can be simple.)
- happens with vision. But it also happens with more complicated processes, like thinking about politics, the pandemic, or the reality of climate change.
- The stories our brain tells are influenced by life experience
- Naive realism is the feeling that our perception of the world reflects the truth.
- The front of the brain thinks both animations are traveling in a diagonal direction.
- We’re not seeing reality. Our vision runs 100 milliseconds behind the real world.
- Neuroscience is deeply humbling
- Your brain makes a lot of unconscious inferences, and it doesn’t tell you that it’s an inference,” he explains. “You see whatever you see. Your brain doesn’t tell you, ‘I took into account how much daylight I’ve seen in my life.’”
- We can build cultures and institutions that celebrate humility and reduce the social cost for saying, “I was wrong.”
- Sometimes, especially when the information we’re receiving is unclear, we see what we want to see. I
- We’re not trying to measure wavelengths, we’re trying to tell something about the color,” Sam Schwarzkopf, a vision scientist at the University of Auckland, says. “And the color is an illusion created by our brain.”
- illusions aren’t just science — they’re provocative art.
- Once light hits the retinas at the back of our eyeballs, it’s converted into an electrical signal that then has to travel to the visual processing system at the back of our brains.
- Our brains work hard to bend reality to meet our prior experiences, our emotions, and our discomfort with uncertainty
- brain predicts the path of motion before it happens.
- cultivate a habit of seeking out perspectives that are not our own.
- You can’t completely remove bias from the brain. “You can’t change the fact that we’ve all grown up in different worlds,” Balcetis said. But you can encourage people to listen to other perspectives and be curious about the veracity of their own.
- We should be curious about our imperfections, as that curiosity may lead us closer to the truth.
- We have this naive realism that the way we see the world is the way that it really is,”
- visual system assumes [the boxes] are moving too, and we get to see them where they would be if they had continued with the motion of the background,”
- the signal travels forward through our brains, constructing what we see and creating our perception of it. This process just takes time.
- The dirty little secret about sensory systems is that they’re slow, they’re lagged, they’re not about what’s happening right now but what’s happening 50 milliseconds ago, or, in the case for vision, hundreds of milliseconds ago,
- That instruction changes what their eyes do,” Balcetis told me last summer. “And it leads them to a different understanding of the nature of the altercation.”
- Even when you’re told about the trick, you can’t unsee the illusion
- The same neurological machinery that leads us to discover the truth can lead us to perceive illusions, and our brains don’t always tell us the difference.
- Our brains like to predict as much as possible, then use our senses to course-correct when the predictions go wrong.
- For moving things — we see them ahead on their path of motion,”
- is actually functional. It helps us overcome these delays and see things ... where they will be when we get there

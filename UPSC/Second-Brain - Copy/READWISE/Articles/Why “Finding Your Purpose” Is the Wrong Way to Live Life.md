## Highlights
- You create it.
- you don’t “find” your purpose.
- At different points in my life, I thought my purpose was to be:
- Moving from one interest or obsession to the next comes with this “letting go” of the identity that was tied to it.
- it’s not about finding or creating any single identity — because the moment you’ve found it, you’ll soon after lose it as well.
- Purpose, as I’ve come to define it, is instead your approach to that journey. It’s your ability to change, adapt, learn and grow, and the emotional wave you ride through that process.
- Some people experience a great deal of disruption as they change.
- Your purpose, as a human, is to go through that creative process over…and over…and over…again.

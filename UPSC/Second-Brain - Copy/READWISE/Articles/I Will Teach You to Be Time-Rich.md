## Highlights
- I wasn‚Äôt over-committed, and I wasn‚Äôt inefficient. I wasn‚Äôt sick, but I wasn‚Äôt well. Or, if time is money ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt poor, but I wasn‚Äôt rich.
- Ramit Sethi says that living the ‚Äúrich life‚Äù is not about rationing your caf√© visits, but taking the big wins like investing, earning a raise, marrying the right person, or whatever allows you to spend big on the things you enjoy.
- What did it mean to be time-rich? I wanted to see time as an ally and to feel it as a rhythmic, benevolent force in my life. It came down to two factors:
- Big rocks: I wanted to have time for the things that were most important for me
- overfull. I wanted to have time for serendipity, adventures, spontaneity, and experiments. I called it the ‚Äúgolden ticket test‚Äù, in honour of my favourite childhood novel: if I found a golden ticket to a magic chocolate factory inside my Wonka Bar, could I immediately drop everything and seize the opportunity?
- Ô∏èManage energy (not time)
- Consider how we talk about time: as if it‚Äôs a resource we can manage
- But we can‚Äôt change the amount of time we have per week, nor the speed at which it passes.
- Time is a natural phenomenon, like a river. And you‚Äôre cruising down that river, at a constant rate.
- So time management has to be about more than doing stuff efficiently until you drop. It has to be about the journey ‚Äî making the process meaningful or useful to us ‚Äî and not only about getting somewhere (after all: the final destination is one of life‚Äôs few guarantees).
- I realised that I couldn‚Äôt manage the river. But I could manage my vessel by being conscious about how I allocated my energy. I could become more efficient by following a rhythm of work and rest, steering my vessel with the flow as much as practical.
- An uninterrupted period on one task tends to be more productive than the same amount of time spread through the day amidst various interruptions.
- we are constantly allocating energy with our attention and can choose to give more attention to the bigger rocks in our lives.
- Be a tortoise (not a bunny)
- Not all to-dos are created equal, so I looked for leverage points.
- ‚ÄúSlow is smooth, and smooth is fast.‚Äù ‚Äî US Navy SEALS proverb
- From simple checklists, processes, new habits, to principles (like these) and even a life philosophy or identity shift, there are actions you can take that will require extra time now, but will save you time in the long run.
- Aim for enough (not perfect)
- Nothing is static so don‚Äôt chase completion. Chase something else like impact, meaning, or just a good story.
- ‚ÄúIf everything seems under control, you‚Äôre not going fast enough.‚Äù

- Time is a natural phenomenon, like a river. And you‚Äôre cruising down that river, at a constant rate. Whether you‚Äôre floating in an inner tube, tinnie in hand, or helmeted up in a kayak, we all follow the same trajectory of working, playing, and doing stuff‚Ä¶ until we‚Äôre not.

- Black time
- Black time is like baseline health, and the tactics below are my daily best-practice prescription to most effectively use your everyday.
- Power break
- If time were health, being in the red is like bleeding out. Your priority is to bandage up, create breathing room and get some of your time back in the black. Read on for your first aid kit.
- Renegotiate your agreements. Are there any deadlines you can push into the future, or projects for which you can hit the snooze button
- Distributed cognition
- You‚Äôre a post-millennial practitioner of productivity as it pertains to a plethora of pursuits, keeping busy like most modern mammals
- The best financial advice for Elon Musk is going to be different from that for the dude flogging The Big Issue outside my local fruit shop
- You are not a computer and context-switching costs you
- It will force you to think about what‚Äôs important to you, come to terms with how committed your weeks are, find a sense of rhythm between work, rest and play, encourage consistency in habits and batch similar tasks into contexts
- You‚Äôll end up with a long list comprising unordered tasks, reminders, and half-baked ideas. But you‚Äôll probably already feel lighter after this thorough mental purge.
- Little wins
- Mise en place (‚Äúeverything in its place‚Äù)
- Triage
- have a place to put important information, outside your mind
- we want to move slowly to move quickly ‚Äî but not too slowly‚Ä¶ huh
- Starting here might look slightly like procrastination by organisation.
- Take a tactical power break to top up your energy.
- Plan your ideal week
- What‚Äôs the quickest, easiest victory you can go after, right now? What‚Äôs the sound of one person high-fiving themselves? Winning gives you dopamine, and the beginning of a virtuous tortoise-rolling-down-a-hill snowballing of energy and achievement.
- brain dump at least weekly, no matter what colour my time is.
- In the red, you‚Äôre in a race against the clock.
- ‚ÄúYour mind is a great place to have ideas, and a terrible place to hold them.‚Äù ‚Äî David Allen
- my ideal week features time blocks for client work (heavy thinking), admin work (light thinking), and even play sessions to help me turn chilling out into a true art form
- The difference is that you‚Äôre organising only up to the point of lining everything up to cook up the next task on your list.
- Working in a disorganised ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù creates drag, but mise en place has other benefits.
- Brain dump (aka mind-sweep)
- Are you really too busy for a 10 minute Tim Tam slam? What if the time-out might make your next few hours more productive? Tortoise beats bunny.
- procrasti-work [forbidden technique]
- ‚ÄúWhat is urgent is seldom important and what is important is seldom urgent.‚Äù ‚Äî Dwight David Eisenhower
- Apart from simply enjoying the good life, the highest-leverage thing you can do will be some form of investment: activities that will yield compound interest on your time. I see two broad categories of investment: you can invest in efficiency or effectiveness.
- Any big addictions or distractions? Are you a procrastinator, a multi-tasker, an over-committer or a people-pleaser?
- Review
- ‚Äútrusted system‚Äù: do you feel comfortable ‚Äúprocrastinating on purpose‚Äù by putting everything other than what you‚Äôre doing right now into the system, to forget about and check later?
- it turns procrastination into a productive pursuit: better to avoid work by doing other work, instead of calling beer o‚Äôclock at midday.
- Do you have a final boss in your time management? A single key offender that accounts for 80% of your time woes?
- . I may never be a morning person ‚Äî however, I can structure my life to limit the damage done
- you brain-dumped to get out of the red is a great starting point. Now organise it. Second Brain, Bullet Journal, commonplace book, Zettelkasten, Life OS, GTD, Playbook (my model)‚Ä¶ your chosen approach doesn‚Äôt matter, as long as it‚Äôs complete enough that it‚Äôs what David Allen calls a
- Time boss
- This is like wellness: going beyond surviving and toward thriving.
- Weekly or otherwise, simple or complex, a review of some kind allows us to adapt to new information, pausing our busy climbing to ensure the ladder‚Äôs leaning against the right wall.
- Personal change is difficult enough without overcomplicating things by trying to change everything at once. So focus on the biggest leverage point you can.
- . Overwhelmed by project A? Switch to project B and do some work on that, until you‚Äôre tired of it, then repeat.
- I prepare everything the night before and avoid screens for an hour before bed to encourage quality rest
- In the red, the answer is clear and urgent: there is a fire that needs extinguishing. But with more time comes more options. What‚Äôs the most important thing you could be doing right now? What would the tortoise do?
- Systems
- You‚Äôre coming to this article with a job or two, a goal or ten, various hobbies and projects.
- The Weekly Review will sharpen your intuitive focus on your important projects as you deal with the flood of new input and potential distractions coming at you the rest of the week.‚Äù ‚Äî David Allen
- Golden (time-rich! üí∞)
- Have two or more projects on the go, and switch between them depending on where your energy/inspiration is.
- Investing in efficiency is like financial investing: you spend time now to receive dividends on that time later.

- Investing in efficiency is like financial investing: you spend time now to receive dividends on that time later.
- Having some good friends, or being involved in a local scene doesn‚Äôt earn a bullet point in many management e-books, but it creates unexpected efficiencies, opportunities and forward motion. Most things are easier, not to mention more fun, in a group.
- You protected and maintained your energy with habits like good sleep, good food, and physical activity.
- Deliberate practice
- Some of the ‚Äúsystems‚Äù I‚Äôve most impactfully built or improved on have been my morning routine, weekly review checklist (discussed earlier) and social circle
- Investing in effectiveness means expanding your capacity.
- And going deep will often win out against going wide in the long run. Mastering a few core areas (and having a few deep relationships) is higher leverage than being a Jack/Jill of all trades.
## New highlights added March 31, 2022 at 8:38 PM
- Physical practice
- Not sporty or into exercise? Take up pole dancing, join the football club, learn to fight‚Ä¶ the best exercise for you is the one you‚Äôll actually do, so exercise on your own terms
- if you‚Äôre allergic to tiny rooms full of other people‚Äôs sweat, go surfing instead. Making it social helps.
- Stillness practice
- It is literally just training one‚Äôs attention, so it will directly increase your capacity for doing stuff effectively. Like physical activity, the ‚Äúbest‚Äù modality is the one you follow through on: if you can‚Äôt stand the idea of sitting in the lotus position for 10 minutes, go for a no-technology-allowed nature walk.
- Retreat
- Take an extended power break as much as possible (I aim for once per year, although once per quarter might be better if you can swing it), to ‚Äúsharpen the saw‚Äù.
- Time rules
- I‚Äôm making time for what‚Äôs important, which includes writing every day. In two short respites from lockdown conditions, I‚Äôve taken two very well-timed holidays interstate with friends, so I‚Äôm cashing those golden tickets too.
- If you‚Äôre a note-taker/rule-maker, use them as a thought starter and modify them to suit yourself.
- Start strong with a morning routine: brief, move, coffee
- End strong with an evening routine: debrief, unplug, relax
- Spend one hour in the gold (for me, writing) as early as possible
- Do first things first: business and deadlines before pleasure. Aim to get to a place where I can completely relax in the evening.
- Be a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù man: Is it essential? Is it exciting? If it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhell yeah‚Äù, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúno‚Äù. Corollary: it‚Äôs alright to say no to everything and ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù.
- Keep my energy up with short regular breaks and exercise every day (even if only a 4-minute Tabata or kettlebell swings)
- Protect my energy: avoid multi-tasking, rushing, and work ‚Äúheroics‚Äù.
- Manage time, not people: be willing and able to drop everything for friends in need.
- Aim for rhythm. Work hard now so I can fully relax tonight. Make Monday organised so Saturday can be wild.

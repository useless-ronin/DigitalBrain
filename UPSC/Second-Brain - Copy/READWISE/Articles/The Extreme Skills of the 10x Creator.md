## Highlights
- Anyone who wants to become a great creator is up against The 10x Creator, a creator ten times, 50 times, or 100 times more productive than the average creator
- Like 10x Engineers, 10x Creators are valuable and rare. They’re not just one standard deviation away from the mean, they’re extreme outliers — one in 2,000,000 — five standard deviations away from the mean.
- 10x Creators aren’t just marginally better than average creators at one skill, they’re decisively better at three — and the combination of these skills gives them massive, compounding, and unfair advantages.
- First, great creators are better at shipping valuable products and content. They have more specific knowledge, and they’re better communicators, writers, and thinkers.
- Second, great creators are better at building systems. Here’s how Elon put it.
- technology has abstracted away so many problems that top creators now look a lot like engineers: pulling together dozens of systems, automating tasks, removing barriers to the act of creation, and performing orders of magnitude better than the average — without code
- Third, top creators are better at leveraging the systems they build. Their creative systems are so efficient and their feedback loops are so tight that they can’t help but produce great work. And these compounding advantages don't even take into account the next logical progression: creators continuously collaborating and investing with each other.
## New highlights added June 7, 2022 at 9:16 PM
- it’s helpful to recognize 10x Creators are playing a different game. Most average creators try to get better at the first skill (shipping valuable content). But the best content is rarely ten, 50, or 100 times better than average content
- “Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage.” While top creators are already five standard deviations away from the mean, even small differences between them can create outsized returns.
- “Just from being marginally better, like running a quarter mile a fraction of a second faster, some people get paid a lot more – orders of magnitude more. Leverage magnifies those differences even more.”
- it’s two or three times as good, so it’s hard to get 10x advantage from great content alone.
- As good as average creators are at shipping, great creators

## Highlights
- You don’t have free will.
- you don’t have as much free will as you think you do. If you want to change your life, change your input.
- Garbage in, garbage out. The reverse is true, too.
- To change your mind, it's best to essentially brainwash yourself with positive and useful information to drown out the noise and negativity of the world.
- Take the Red Pill
- “The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.” — Morpheus
- If he takes the blue pill, he’ll go back to his normal life, a life of ignorant bliss or ignorant ignorance, depending on how you think about it. If he takes the red pill, he’ll know the truth about the world.
- You don’t get to live a successful life without knowing the truth about the world. You’ll have to see the world for what it is, the good, bad, and ugly. To manoeuvre properly, you can’t have your head buried in the sand.
- Because 95 per cent of people live in the black and white, either-or, binary world that causes all the problems we’re having today. You will want to shake these people, scream at them, and dump loads of facts and information in front of them. But they won’t listen.
- They won’t listen because they are demoralized by propaganda. Fully plugged. Trying to explain propaganda to them would be like trying to tell a fish it lives in water. It’s too late for them. Focus on saving yourself and those who can be saved still.
- How to Gain Wisdom
- ‘Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.
- People often tell me I’m wise. I’m not. I just study life, a lot. Spoiler alert — not much about it has changed.
- I’m constantly on the hunt for information — the truth about the world.
- Society would tell you opportunities are limited. My studies have shown me opportunities are insanely abundant.
- Society tells you to get into debt, become a slave to consumerism, and then complain about your lot in life. My studies have shown me how to build wealth by buying assets.
- once you start to crack open a few books you realize you have the cheat codes to life. You’ll continually think to yourself “How did I not know this? Why didn’t anyone tell me this?”
- All the puzzle pieces to a good life will fit together seamlessly and you’ll feel like you know these secrets, except they’re not secrets at all.
- Society would tell you that you’re rational. My studies tell me you’re completely irrational, which is something you can use to your benefit by correcting your mental errors and taking advantage of the mental errors of others.
- most are too brainwashed to fully reach that layer in their mind.
- Build a Fortress for Your Mind
- “People look for retreats for themselves, in the country, by the coast, or in the hills . . . There is nowhere that a person can find a more peaceful and trouble-free retreat than in his own mind. . . . So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself.” — Marcus Aureilus
- I’d read the same books three times, watch the same videos dozens of times, I’d study these concepts until I had a deep second-nature understanding of them.
- Read the book Total Recall by Arnold Schwarzenegger. It’s an autobiography, but it’s a sneakily good self-improvement book — one of the best. Basically, he used the same strategy to get ridiculously strong and applied it to all areas of his life. Reps, reps, reps.
- He knew nothing about real estate and went on to own a multi-million dollar portfolio. How? He studied thousands of properties and had conversations with tons of real estate experts. Reps, reps, reps.
- With physical training and acting training for roles in action films. Reps, reps, reps.
- You get your reps in. You study and implement it over and over and over again until it works. That’s it.
- Move Forward No Matter What

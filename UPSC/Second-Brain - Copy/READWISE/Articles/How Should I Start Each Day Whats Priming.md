# Highlights 
Many people wake up feeling completely drained, and although they want to be focused and successful, they don’t have the mental energy to accomplish their goals.  ^289564127

---

You can learn to change your state of mind by changing your physical state with an effective priming routine.  ^289564128

---

What is priming?  ^289564129

---

One way to define priming is the act of taking time to adjust your thoughts and emotions so you can live your life in your peak state. Priming is most powerful when completed in the morning to set a productive and powerful tone for your day.  ^289564130

---

has been proven with science and psychology.  ^289564131

---

It all happens completely within your subconscious, but you can still learn how to use priming to your advantage  ^289564132

---

When you learn how to set and reset your mood, you’ll prime yourself for success.  ^289564133

---

Psychologists theorize that priming occurs because we store information in our long-term memories in groups, or “schemas.” When we see a word or image, the rest of the group to which it belongs is also activated, and the related information is easier to access.  ^289564134

---

Participants who held hot coffee rated the person as happier, better-natured and more generous and social. Participants who held the cold cup were more likely to say the person was unhappy, irritable and selfish.  ^289564135

---

there was absolutely no difference between the profiles that both groups read. But how they reacted to the descriptions was significantly different. The strangest part? They had no idea they’d been primed.  ^289564136

---

Negative emotions lead to negative experiences  ^289564137

---

Think about an instance when you were angry or frustrated – did you overreact to a small problem? Did everything seem worse because you were still hung up on the event that made you angry? You were feeling the priming effect of your anger, which caused you to react a certain way.  ^289564138

---

Now think of a moment when you were totally in love and felt alive and awake to the gift of life. Did everything seem easier to deal with? Did you look at those you may not have liked in the past and feel a new sense of appreciation  ^289564139

---

Our thoughts, feelings and emotions can be primed by factors we’re not even aware of, which greatly impacts our performance in other aspects of our lives  ^289564140

---

When practiced correctly and often, priming can help you cultivate positive emotions and drastically improve the quality of your life.  ^289564141

---

It’s proven that positive priming increases processing speed while negative priming slows it.  ^289564142

---

The theory is that even though the stimulus is not fully visible, individuals still react to it.  ^289564143

---

Repetition priming  ^289564144

---

After enough repetition, an individual will be much more likely to respond to the second word when they hear the first.  ^289564145

---

This is the type of priming you can harness to get what you want out of life. It’s achieved when two words are continually paired together.  ^289564146

---

Creating a morning ritual that includes priming is the perfect way to start your day. What you do in the morning has a powerful and long-lasting impact on the rest of your day.  ^289564147

---

as little as 10 minutes a day, you can experience benefits in your performance, mood and state.  ^289564148

---

1. Sit
Find a chair in a relatively quiet area and sit actively. Place both feet on the floor, shift your shoulders back, chest up, and hold your neck long and your head high.  ^289564149

---

2. Breathe
By changing your breath, you change your state of being. Tony’s method incorporates a breathing exercise with three sets of 30 breaths, with a pause in between each set. 1 MINUTE  ^289564150

---

3. Begin heart breathing
Put your hands on your heart. Feel its power and strength as you breathe into it. 30 SECONDS  ^289564151

---

4. Practice gratitude  ^289564152

---

Think of three things you’re really grateful for right now. They can be from your past, present or future. Step into the first moment and picture it as vividly as possible. After about a minute, go to the second thing, then onto the next. Pro tip: Make one of these things simple, like a child’s smile or a time someone said, “thank you” and really meant it. Even on your worst days, you can find something small and meaningful to be grateful for. 3 MINUTES  ^289564153

---

5. Visualize
Now comes the part that’s like a blessing or a prayer. It can be as spiritual as you want it to be. Tony imagines colorful light coming down and filling his body, healing anything that needs to be healed – body, thoughts, emotions, feelings. Envision your problems being washed away. Ask for the best parts of you to be strengthened. 1 MINUTE AND 30 SECONDS  ^289564154

---

6. Share
Now send all the energy you’ve gotten through your healing and strengthening out to others. Feel the energy going up and down, pouring out to your family, loved ones, colleagues, clients, friends and even strangers you’ve only met once. 1 MINUTE AND 30 SECONDS  ^289564155

---

7. Focus and celebrate
Now think about the three outcomes or goals that you want to achieve the most. These are things that will excite you once they’re completed. What would achieving them feel like? Place yourself in that position of achievement and celebrate that feeling of completion and victory. Visualize how it will impact you and what those victories could do for those around you. As with gratitude, go through each outcome one by one, fully experiencing the feeling of success. 3 MINUTES  ^289564156

---

8. Get ready to rock
 Take as long as you’d like to stretch and reflect on all of the positive work you just did. You are now positioned to excel in the state of your optimal self. Stay in character and get out there to conquer the day.  ^289564157

---

Priming psychology is the study of how the brain makes unconscious associations and decisions.  ^289564158

---

Priming is one way that our brain connects our memories; when we see or hear a certain “trigger,” we make associations based on that trigger without even realizing it.  ^289564159

---

Priming affects the actions and behaviors of every human being – and most of us don’t even know it.  ^289564160

---

Your implicit memory stores thoughts and events without your explicit awareness – and you cannot bring these memories into awareness by choice  ^289564161

---

positive priming has more benefits for your mind and your life than negative priming.  ^289564162

---

priming speeds up your reaction time by improving your memory processes.  ^289564163

---

Are you ready to start achieving your goals and creating real, lasting change in your life?  ^289564164

---

When you prime your mind to experience more positivity, you’ll not only find more fulfillment in the everyday, but you’ll also become better at reaching your goals. But don’t take our word for it – give it a try yourself.  ^289564165

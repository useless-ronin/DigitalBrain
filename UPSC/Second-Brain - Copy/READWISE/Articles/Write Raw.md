## Highlights
- my essays are all really just stream-of-consciousness journal entries.
- He recommends a daily stream-of-consciousness exercise that he calls Crash & Burn.
- my process is as simple as it gets: I sit down, I write, I write, I write, and only get up when I’m finished. I wrestle with an idea an just follow my thoughts as they take me up and down the page
- There’s no planning, no notes, no draft, or editing. I’m just getting words out of my head onto the screen.
- maybe not good writing in a way a professor of literature would approve. Powerful writing is a better term.
- Right now, you can feel my energy, right? You can feel that I’m speaking directly to you. Every thought is moving straight from my mind into your head. Unfiltered. Raw.
- Every time a text is edited, edges get smoothened out. But it’s precisely these edges that make a text interesting.
- When you’re planning and editing, you’ll always be tempted to remove paragraphs that make you feel uneasy. “Maybe I shouldn’t say that.”, “This could be misunderstood”, “That’s a bit too harsh.”. So what’s left is bland and boring
- If you’re meticulously planning you texts, a smart reader will be able to anticipate where you’re going.
- with Crash & Burn writing, even I have no idea what I’m going to say next.
- write what I really think. This is my little corner of the internet and I do here whatever I want.
- I’m doing it to get thoughts out of my system to make room for new ideas. So I don’t care about the outcome, if anyone will ever read or like it. My only focus is on the process itself.
- don’t let anyone convince you that writing is complicated, that you first need to learn some complex process, or that you need to put in a lot of effort to polish your text.
- Just sit down and write down what you really think.

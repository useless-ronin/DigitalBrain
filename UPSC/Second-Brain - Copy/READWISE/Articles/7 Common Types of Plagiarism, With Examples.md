## Highlights
- Plagiarism is the act of passing off someone else’s work as your own. That’s the most basic definition—there’s actually a lot more nuance to it, and you might be surprised to learn just how many different kinds of plagiarism exist.
- Plagiarism should be avoided for a variety of reasons. For one, it’s dishonest. Put simply, presenting another writer’s work as your own is lying.
- Another reason to avoid plagiarism is that you don’t learn anything by plagiarizing another’s work
- It’s also disrespectful to the original author
- Copying another artist’s work is a form of plagiarism, taking credit for another scientist’s research is plagiarism, and copying another app’s code and building your own with it without recognizing the original programmer is plagiarism.
- any act of presenting another person’s work as your own is an act of plagiarism. When you profit from an act of plagiarism, it’s known as intellectual property theft. Intellectual property theft is a criminal offense.
- 1 Complete plagiarism
- An example of complete plagiarism is submitting a research paper for English class that your older sister wrote and submitted when she took the class five years ago.
- 2 Direct plagiarism
- With direct plagiarism, specific sections or paragraphs are included without crediting (or even acknowledging) the author.
- An example of direct plagiarism is dropping a line or two from your source directly into your work without quoting or citing the source.
- 3 Paraphrasing plagiarism
- if you’re presenting someone else’s original idea in your writing without crediting them, even if you’re presenting it in your own words, it’s plagiarism.
- 4 Self-plagiarism
- Self-plagiarism can be an issue if you write professionally. When you’re commissioned to write for a client, the client owns that work. Reusing your own words for subsequent clients is plagiarizing your own work and can damage your professional reputation (as well as make your clients look bad).
- 5 Patchwork plagiarism
- An example of patchwork plagiarism is taking a clause from a source and embedding it in a sentence of your own.
- 6 Source-based plagiarism
- 7 Accidental plagiarism

# Highlights 
Analog Writers love practicing in hiding.  ^278319287

There is this belief in the “old” world of writing and publishing that in order to produce your best work, you must be alone. You must have peace and quiet. You must sit in your room, let your imagination marinate in the moonlight, and if you are able to connect to the magic of The Word Gods for long enough, then maybe, just maybe, you will write something brilliant.  ^278319288

If you want to know why so many Analog Writers become alcoholics, this is why  ^278319289

---

Digital Writers, on the other hand, don’t believe in such wizardry.  ^278319290

---

Digital Writers understand that they have no idea what their “best” work is or isn’t.  ^278319291

---

it’s much easier to hide away in your room, declaring yourself a genius.  ^278319292

---

But facing this reality is also where all the growth is.  ^278319293

---

For Digital Writers, feedback loops can be as short as a few minutes.  ^278319294

---

Unfortunately, Analog Writers have a hard time making the switch.  ^278319295

---

As a result, they:Never experience writer’s blockNever run out of ideasNever have to “put all their eggs in one basket”Never go crazy wondering what’s worth writing, next  ^278319296

---

The sooner you confront what’s not working, the faster you’ll learn what does.  ^278319297

---

when you write on social platforms and share pieces and snippets of your unrefined ideas, the writing process transforms from being one of solitary confinement into a collaborative effort between you and the readers you claim to want to serve most.  ^278319298

---

Practicing in public is scary because it means facing the harshest reality you can face as a writer: “Do people care about what I’m writing? Am I any good?”  ^278319299

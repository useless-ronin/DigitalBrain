# Highlights 
you’ve got it all wrong if you think building an audience is followers.  ^278699069

---

What if you have 10,000 followers and nobody buys your $1.99 or $99 product? What will you do with those followers?  ^278699070

---

Followers are people who hit the follow button.An audience supports you, engages with you, and has a relationship with you.  ^278699071

---

You just need 5 people who engage with you, and then with network effects, their audience will discover you. That's the power of social networking.  ^278699072

---

Connect to people on a deeper level.  ^278699073

---

Use your stories to do so.  ^278699074

---

I was public about having my surgery. Not for sympathy, but because when I was in bed for six weeks my mental state was on a downward spiral. I was jealous of everybody who could even walk or stand because I couldn’t.  ^278699075

---

Use your expertise to help others.What is networking without building connections?What is personal branding without being more you?What are followers who don’t root for you?  ^278699076

---

Your virality will get you lots of views. It’ll even lead a lot of people to hit the follow button. But it won’t make people connect to you on a deeper level, as they should.  ^278699077

---

A friend, who I don’t know in real life and lives on the opposite side of the globe, checked in with me every week post my surgery. He didn’t have to. There was nothing he got out of it. He didn’t upsell me into buying anything.  ^278699078

---

People who I call ‘friends’ didn’t check up on me. Gym buddies who live 5 minutes away didn’t text me, leave alone meet me. But this person did. And for that, I’ll always hold him highly in my heart.  ^278699079

---

don’t forget that building an audience differs from having followers. Building an audience is being a part of a community, it's a two-way relationship.  ^278699080

---

No amount of any number will make you feel as happy as the human sending you kindness from their screen, who has absolutely nothing to gain from you.  ^278699081

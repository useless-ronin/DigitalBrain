## Highlights
- Dumping all your tasks into a task manager and hoping by some miracle everything will be fine is not going to work
- you need a process or workflow in which the app will fit:
- This means it doesn’t matter what task manager you use as long as it ticks those boxes.
- all these additional features, while nice to have, do nothing to enhance your productivity or time management.
- Being more productive and better at managing your time comes down to one thing. How much are you producing in the time you have available.
- the more features your productivity apps have, the less productive you will be. You will play, tweak and fiddle, and while doing that, you will not be producing anything.
- There’s a reason the most productive people are using the same set of apps they’ve used for the last 10+ years
- Those notes represent her life from starting at university to the present day. She had her journal in there, her course notes, professional notes (meetings, projects etc.) and her self-development track.
- pick a simple task manager and notes app and focus on doing the work.
- Collect everything into a trusted place (task manager, notes app).Process what you collected and delete the unnecessary every 24–48 hours.What you decide to keep, organise by when you will do the task.Do the tasks.
- Don’t have more than one calendar — you only have one period of twenty-four hours. Adding another calendar app for your personal life won’t magically give you another twenty-four hours.
- develop your system.
- We are all different, and your system and processes must work for you
- plan the next day before they finish this one.
- The goal is to keep things as simple as possible. Over thinking, things and constantly searching for the next shiny new app will not get your work done. If you want to be more productive and to free up time for the things you aim to do, then put all your focus and attention on getting your work done.

## Highlights
- the calendar event only tells you when tasks are due, not when to do them.
- The schedule keeps track of appointments, and the to-do list keeps track of tasks.
- The agenda
- Schedule = Calendar.
- To-do list = Actions.Calendar + Actions = Agenda.
- An agenda helps us measure our time, both before and after the moment.
- Plan too much? An agenda will reveal the need to eliminate some things. Plan too little? An agenda will show the openings that can be leveraged.
- Afterward, an agenda helps you evaluate your time — measuring what was spent vs what was budgeted, noting where corrections are needed. Are you making time for your family and friends? Are you setting aside consistent time to work on your goals? Ideally, the things we value most will be aligned with the blocks of time we reserve in our agendas.
- It takes time
- We jump back and forth between phone calls and email and chat and that big project. By the time we finish, we’ve switched context so many times we have no idea how long the project or primary task itself actually took to complete.
- Own your time
- Have some humility as you make your plans. Know that things will come up and you will have to adjust. Better to set a course and make corrections as needed than wander with only a vague idea of where you are going or why.
- Switch to an agenda

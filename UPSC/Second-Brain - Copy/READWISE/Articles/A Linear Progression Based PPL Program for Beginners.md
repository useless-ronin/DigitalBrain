# Highlights 
What I'm going to write here is an attempt to reconcile these two ideas and produce a sane way for a beginner to train more frequently and give the attention to the glamour muscles that they want, while also progressing in a correct, appropriate manner  ^278319820

---

The main lifts are just the first exercises of the day, and these are always going to be done heavier than the other lifts of that day. The lifts that follow are accessory lifts, designed to build muscle, balance out weakpoints and improve your strength in the main lifts.  ^278319821

---

But strength progression is important, especially as a novice, for making you more muscular  ^278319822

---

the more you can lift, the bigger you'll be.  ^278319823

---

if you're a beginner because your body doesn't need much stimulus to adapt.  ^278319824

---

Without this, you won't make any adaptations (strength gains or size gains).  ^278319825

---

2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)2.5kg/5lbs for squats5kg/10lbs for deadlifts  ^278319826

---

By As Many Reps As Possible, it really means As many reps as possible while still maintaining good form.  ^278319827

---

keep rep quality high  ^278319828

---

the real moneymaker from this comes in when you deload.  ^278319829

---

I'm a big believer in just practising the movement as a warmup. So you can use bench press to warm up for bench press. Or squats to warm up for squats. You get the idea. The goal of a warmup is to get blood into the muscles and joints that are going to be used, and also to start drilling the motor patterns into your body for form purposes.  ^278319830

---

do whatever you want to get yourself prepared for the lifts  ^278319831

---

The only recommendation is that I would avoid static stretches before lifting.  ^278319832

---

Rest as long as is needed between sets. For a general guideline, I would recommend:3-5 minutes between your first exercise of the day1-3 minutes between all your other exercises  ^278319833

---

Treat it more as template than gospel.  ^278319834

---

If you want to lift heavy weights, then you need to lift heavy weights. I know this sounds stupid, but it makes sense.  ^278319835

---

15-20 reps is a great range for increasing endurance.  ^278319836

---

If you feel a specific bodypart is lacking, throw in a couple of extra sets for it, ideally isolation  ^278319837

---

Both. Nobody got big benching 1 plate regardless of how good their form is. You should push the weights up and continue progressing as long as your form is acceptable.  ^278319838

---

ong as your form is acceptable and not injurious, then continue adding weight  ^278319839

---

A beginner lifter is defined as someone who can make progress workout to workout:  ^278319840

---

Once this linear progression stalls out, and you take longer to recover between workouts because the weights are heavier (and therefore the systemic stress is higher), you become an intermediate lifter  ^278319841

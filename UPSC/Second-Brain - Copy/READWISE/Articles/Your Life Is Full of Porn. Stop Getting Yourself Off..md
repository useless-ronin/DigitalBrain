## New highlights added July 18, 2022 at 4:12 PM
- Lifestyle porn is all about people you’ll never meet and places you may never get to go.
- It’s a curated list of the top 1% of experiences you could have in your life. The lifestyle looks perfect.
- You never see what it takes to earn the lifestyle, only the end result which is the lifestyle.
- Your lifestyle is never going to be the same as someone else and that’s the point. You can create your own lifestyle rather than copy a porn version you’ll never have.
- Money Porn
- A laptop makes you think making money is easy.
- If money was so gosh damn simple, we’d all be rolling in it and nobody would ever need to wake up early for work again
- Money porn sells the dream that cash will solve all your problems.
- porn is a lie. Without meaning and fulfillment, money won’t do a thing for you.
- can cause you to be a jerk and be addicted to the ridiculous goal of having to be first while others lose.
- Startup Porn
- Adding too much risk to your life will only stress you out, leading you to make terrible decisions you’ll regret later in life.
- Revenge Porn
- You can sabotage other people in the comment’s section of their posts or in the hidden chamber of secrets known as direct messages. Seeking revenge feels good. Seeing people lose, so you can, win seems obvious.
- The more people you help, the better you do for yourself. If you help people, they will help you in return.
- You can do more when you collaborate, than you can by yourself. The game of life is rigged against you.
- People “Doing It” Porn
- Porn consisting of people having sex is not good for you either. Most of this content shows scenes and acts you can never replicate. The bar you have for physical looks and crazy sexual acts will only increase.
- Influencer Porn
- “I really miss when people understood that people who consume their content are a community, not a group of people that are there to serve their ambitions.”
- The influencer movement is a lie designed to keep you on social media platforms so you continue to play the game
- Use social media, absolutely — but use it to be helpful and for a cause greater than your own selfish desires.
- Followers and a brand won’t make you rich, successful, happy or die with no regrets.
- Cure Your Porn Addictions with This.
- The secret to kill all forms of porn is discipline.
- Discipline yourself to focus on what you know is good for you. You have a list of habits already that you probably follow — like exercise, reading, leisure time, meditation — and you can focus your time there and get far better returns than the endless porn-fuelled addictions of meaningless nonsense.
- Whatever your version of porn is, abolish it.You can get yourself off with life, rather than porn. It feels better too.

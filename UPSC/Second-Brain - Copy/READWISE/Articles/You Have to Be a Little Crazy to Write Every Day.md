## Highlights
- The shouting, hammering, and drilling is constant, but it’s not annoying like a house getting built across the street.
- It’s a sign that you're built to accomplish big things in your life.
- You see the big picture
- With the creator economy in full swing, I’ve had a taste of what it has to offer, and I want more.
- you’re a little crazy if you’re writing after a full day. But I commend you. You’re doing it because you know what it takes to make it as a creator these days.
- you do it anyway because you know what the potential is. I’ll tell you this right now; blogging is a gateway to endless possibilities.
- “Do anything for five years, and you’re a pro.”
- It doesn’t take a lot of time to build an empire.

- “Do anything for five years, and you’re a pro.”
- It doesn’t take a lot of time to build an empire.
- Utilize flow states to write quickly. Reach peak performance listing to music to get you in the zone. Eat and caffeinate before your writing session. This way you have lots of energy.
- Don't even think about editing it today. Wait till tomorrow while your brain is fresh.
- Write your heart out. Don’t look at the time. Take a moment to breathe. Write one true sentence at a time.
- Crazy people press submit.
- You need to pretend that ideas are semi-trucks without working brakes. The idea isn’t going to stop for you. You need to capture it yourself, or it’ll drive on over to another person crazy enough to get in the way.
- You have to send the story in even when you don’t think it’s perfect.
- , the perfectionist is afraid of what others will say. That’s a normal, human thought to have. Fearing public opinion is natural, and, to be honest, I understand.

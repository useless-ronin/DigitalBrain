## Highlights
- Getting rich is a nightmare.… If you use it to boost your ego or help contribute to the downfall of society.
- use a money as a tool to buy back your time and then help others, it can do a helluva lot of good
- You no longer have to commute to some shabby office and sit in an open plan prison cell if you don’t want to.
- A bizarre form of online course
- Most online courses suck
- Bad quality videoNot much effortPoorly marketedTerrible visualsToo longPoor audio recorded on a laptop micToo much FOMO and hyperbole in sales emailsThe same boring image of the teacher for 20 hoursNot enough social proof with the topic they’re teachingNot enough teaching for free, first, before trying to sellToo many sales emails. Too much asking. Too much selfishness
- Strategy to copy
- Don’t be a dumbass. Teach what you know. Make the course high quality. Now, if you can’t, no problemo: sell someone else’s course until you can.
- NFTs
- Coaching via Zoom
- Coaching is a dirty word.
- Many people need help. They’d love to skip the line and access your library of experience to save time, which saves them money.
- You’re worried about charging for coaching. Potential coaching customers are worried they won’t find answers to their problems.
- you can stay in your underwear and just put on an unwashed t-shirt to speak with clients. Then go nude when you log off Zoom if you want.
- Strategy to copy
- Publish content onlineContent will create inbound emails and direct messagesAnswer audience questionsIf someone wants to go deeper tell them you have a small online business that does that.If the person responds back and is interested then tell them your rate and accept payment via TransferWise or PayPal.
- Selling links to stuff you love
- Share that link with people you tell about the product. Or produce content about it and link to it using your affiliate link.
- Using affiliate links is simpler than creating your own products and services.
- Get affiliate links for three things you love. Share them.
- The Vanilla ice cream strategy
- Tech is the future. Investing in it isn’t hard.
- I learned tech isn’t a bubble destined for collapse. The way we measure the performance of tech and our investment portfolio has changed. You can’t apply 1980s stock principles to a new asset class.
- The old model used to measure value. The new model measures community.
- Becoming a fugly rogue
- Right now it’s unsexy to talk about crypto with prices so low. I don’t give a fudge. Short term prices have zero correlation to a long term future fuelled by adoption.
- Don’t build a website. Nope.Test an idea with a platform like Gumroad.Start with low friction until you find a sweet spot where people are happy to pay you money in return for value — education, entertainment, inspiration, more time.
- The road less traveled
- For the record, I hate TikTok.
- TikTok
- People are making stupid amounts of money on there because it’s easy to build an audience if you can hold a phone and say something interesting.
- Strategy to copy
- Make TikTok videos. Link to a product or service. It’s that simple.

# Highlights 
Aspiring writers act as if I came out of the womb knowing how to write well.I worked my ass off for seven years.  ^289564271

---

many writers will tell me they love this technique but they won’t use it — even some of the students in my blogging course.  ^289564272

---

Write down ten ideas for blog post headlines every day.  ^289564273

---

To this day, only two or three of the headline ideas are good. Only one in a handful of sessions are great.  ^289564274

---

A few have become the seeds for legendary viral posts that built my career. But I never knew when the greatest ideas would come. I just worked at them every day  ^289564275

---

I stole the idea technique from James Altucher. I steal stuff from people all the time. You’ve probably heard the concept of stealing like an artist. I stole that too.  ^289564276

---

Most people try way too hard to be original. People who try to be original never get anything done.  ^289564277

---

you’re not so smart and creative that you have an idea that no one else has thought of before.  ^289564278

---

Of course, there are anomalies, but you’re probably not one of them. Sorry.  ^289564279

---

Learn how to stand on the shoulders of giants, borrow from timeless wisdom, and draw from a variety of sources to come up with ideas of your own  ^289564280

---

I’m always looking for a way to combine and remix source material into something that’s unique because of the way I combined and remixed it.  ^289564281

---

Practice your craft while living said life, and you’ll realize everything is material  ^289564282

---

it’s always important to keep a pen and paper handy. You never know when an idea will strike. Or where.  ^289564283

---

You’ll take yourself seriously as an artist, an entrepreneur, a career ascender — anyone who needs ideas as currency — when you realize that every second of your life is a chance to observe and draw insight.  ^289564284

---

“Nothing bad can happen to a writer. Everything is material.”  ^289564285

---

the lows are usually more compelling because there are few things more authentic than feeling like crap.  ^289564286

---

Consume AND Create  ^289564287

---

sometimes being lazy makes you more creative.  ^289564288

---

It’s a slippery slope for sure. But you can find great ideas in moments where you’re casually consuming instead of boldly creating.  ^289564289

---

Go ahead and blow a whole day reading a novel. Visit a museum and wander around for a while. Spend 12 hours straight watching interesting YouTube videos and documentaries.  ^289564290

---

writing suffers when I don’t consume enough.  ^289564291

---

Again, it’s easy to fall into the trap of constant consumption without creating anything or generating legitimate ideas, which leads me to my next point.  ^289564292

---

Stop being  ^289564293

---

Stop being lazy.  ^289564294

---

Come up with ideas every single day.Focus on your craft every single day.“Writer’s block is a phony, made up, b.s. excuse for not doing your work.” — Jerry Seinfield  ^289564295

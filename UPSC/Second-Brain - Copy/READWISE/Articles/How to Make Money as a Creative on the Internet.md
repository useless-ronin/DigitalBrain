## Highlights
- We have been creating solutions to make our lives easier for the entirety of human evolution
- Low-skill labor jobs are being phased out. History has shown this pattern time and time again. There is no escaping this phase of evolution.
- If the work doesn’t require creativity, you can bet your future that it will be delegated, automated, or phased out
- take responsibility for your future and relentlessly self-educate.
- Create Or Be Created
## New highlights added June 29, 2022 at 9:25 PM
- Creativity is to create clarity from chaos.
  Create + clarity = creativity.
- The 3 Point Business Model
- Specific knowledge is — in the context of this letter — is a creative solution that you find by collecting and connecting dots through self-education and building personal projects.
- Creativity Is Not Inherently Valuable
- Get out of tutorial hell.
- Creation is the process of molding, controlling, and ordering consciousness (that can be tapped into via the subconscious). At that point, we can bring that gift into the world via the senses.
- This is the foundation of creativity — the ability to pull from, connect, and solve problems from the depths of infinity.
- You cannot tap into your creative ability when your focus is unconscious and narrow.
  You can tap into your full creative ability when your focus is conscious and open.
- Why would someone start personal project when they have no idea what to do after they start (and sometimes have no idea how TO start)?
  That’s exactly why you should start one.
- Start with the ones that are most practical to distributing your value — marketing, branding, persuasion, and sales.
- For 1 month, only consume information related to what you are trying to learn.
- 2) Start a personal project with potential profitability.
- Awareness.
- 1) Immerse yourself in an echo chamber of information related to the skill you are trying to learn.
- Creative solutions to modern problems are how you pull in the big bucks.
- want to be able to sell a creative solution, you need to be able to attract people to that solution. In other words, you need traffic and distribution.
- 3) Embrace the chaos and understand that nothing worth having is predictable.
- You want to gain awareness — collect the dots — in the iceberg of mastery you are diving into.
- It is absolutely crucial that you study all facets of human understanding:
  Storytelling
  Psychology
  Spirituality
  Philosophy
  Marketing
  Sales
  Branding
  Persuasion
  Design or visual storytelling
  Color theory
  Capturing attention
  Yourself (self-awareness)
- is okay if you start over from scratch.
  It is not okay if you abandon the unconventional path as a whole.
  When in doubt, take some time off and reflect on your exploration for a meaningful life through the unknown.
- Our subconscious stores everything that we have been made aware of at some point in our lives.
- Create certainty from uncertainty
  Create sense from non-sense
  Create clarity from chaos
  Create focus from distraction
  Create signal from noise
  Create something from nothing
  Create success from failure
  Create meaning from struggle
  Create life from death
  Create positive from negative
- How do you learn these skills?
- Human understanding is an iceberg that everyone must master.
- Living in the now or “being present” isn’t exclusive to spiritual people. It is a necessity for living a life of joy, creativity, and wonder
- you don’t understand what humans perceive as valuable, you will never be able to live off of that profession.
- value is dictated by perception. What you deem valuable may be a hunk of garbage to the next person.
- You need to play the money Game if you want to make money
- The easiest way to start making money is by starting a service business related to your expertise.
- 3) A creative solution to iterate on.
- It is common practice to teach from the perspective of the people that are 2-3 steps behind you. If I told you what I do now and you haven’t even started — it will go straight over your head.
- 2) Start a twitter account.
- Focus on helping people for free to understand their problems.
- The market is not and never will be saturated. We have returned to 5th century BC where the power is back in the individuals hands rather than organizations or corporations.
- I am not saying conversion centered websites or sales funnels are bad. They are a part of the ladder. You just won’t be able to charge the premium price that you want to without practice and iteration
- Authority comes from depth and expertise. What better way to build that authority than making a high quality newsletter the main pillar of your business?
- Stop trying to get a level 100’s results while you are level 10.
- All you need is half a brain and the ability to type.
- Work your way up the ladder.
- You begin to collect dots that will turn into a creative solution or system that you can sell at a premium.
- 95% of my sales come from my long form content. It builds trust that others can’t compete with.
- most people are playing the short-form content game with no authority to show for it.
- Anyone can write less than 280 characters and press “send tweet.”
- 1) Start a weekly newsletter.
- Because building an audience and leverage was the greatest thing I ever did for myself.
- Dive into the unknown starting today. Start gaining XP in the real world.

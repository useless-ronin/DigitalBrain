## Highlights
- Tips for consistent growth and honing your voice
- I’m not even going to pretend any of my tips will guarantee writing success because they won’t.
- I’m going to do what I always do with my writing. I’m going to share some best practices I’ve learned over time, leave them to you to try them, and help you understand that all advice is meant to increase your odds of success.
- If you don’t have the results you want, if you don’t write or publish as often as you should, if you feel like you’re not getting any better, maybe try listening to someone with some experience instead of continuing to only do things your way.
- One side says that you should focus on perfecting your craft before you go public with your work. Ernest Hemingway was known for his masochistic level of editing — sometimes revising the endings of his books dozens of times.
- The Two-Sided Debate on How to Become a Better Writer
- Others debate that quantity leads to quality. The more you write and publish, the better you are at iterating in real-time by using the feedback from your published work to create better pieces in the future.
- Some take a similar approach to books like James Altucher who wrote a runaway bestseller, Choose Yourself, after previously writing 16 books that failed.
- I prefer the prolific approach for a few reasons:
- The speed of today’s publishing world
- Being prolific helps you stay on your target audience’s radar and keeps your work from being too dated in a fast-paced world.
- Your psychology
- Perfectionism can pay off in a big way, but it can also devastate you if your work isn’t as successful as you thought it’d be and cause you to quit.
- Momentum and consistency
- Most aspiring writers lack consistency, which keeps them from building a career.
- If you have momentum and consistency first, true craftsmanship and timeless work can come from a result of it.
- Being prolific gives you more bets to make this happen. Choose the approach that fits you best.
- You can write, and write, and write, but if you’re not paying attention to the results you’re getting, your practice can ultimately lead nowhere.
- Aspiring writers get stuck in their ways. They want to do it their way and automatically expect people to love their work just because they wrote it.
- there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a free country, write whatever you want, but your results are on you.
- Become a student of writing success. Read an article that gives step by step info on persuasive writing techniques and then implement them.
- I studied people like James Altucher, Jon Morrow, Ryan Holiday, Brianna Wiest, and Jeff Goins when I was on my come up. I’d read popular writing blogs like copy blogger. I took online courses. I studied ruthlessly.
- Understand the concept of “standing on the shoulders of giants.” Your predecessors worked hard at their craft, not just for their own sake, but to pay that knowledge forward to future generations. Why waste unnecessary time trying to figure out what works when someone has already done it for you?
- . If you want a real shortcut for learning how to become a successful writer, study directly underneath a successful writer.
- Find the Right Tools to Build Your Writing Career
- When you’re building skills on your path to learning how to become a better writer, you want to focus on building a “tool belt” of different little writing frameworks you collect over time
- When I first wanted to learn headlines, I’d write dozens of them at a time. I still write 10 new headlines every single day
- If I wanted to write great intros, I’d made sure the intro of each new article was amazing and I wouldn’t beat myself up about writing the entire post perfectly.
- When I learned about power words, words, and phrases that evoke emotions and persuade, I’d go overboard on adding these words, maybe even to the point I oversaturated my posts with them. I’d find a balance over time and all of my posts had the foundational pillar of great introductions
- Once you ‘hammer in’ a certain technique, it becomes second nature, which frees up mental space to try a new one. Eventually, you have this intuitive set of skills you can use in everything you write
- The Secret to “Finding Your Voice”
- How is it that we all have access to the same 26 letters, yet we come up with totally different ways of combining them?
- Your voice is a combination of a few sources.
- writing more often helps you shape your thought process and worldview. Writing forces you to articulate your beliefs.
- Sometimes you’ll try to form an argument with your writing, find holes in it, and change your mind because of the holes you found. In the end, you build a unique style due to a unique belief system.
- confidence that comes from building writing skills helps you show more of your personality
- I’m a wise-ass by nature and injecting sarcastic humor, shit-talking, made writing more fun and helped me connect with like-minded people who appreciate that style.
- The moral of the story — Audiences will start to love your writing because they love you. Every topic under the sun has already been covered. The only way to stand out is to use the only unfair advantage you have.
- Nobody else can beat you at being you.
- Your writing is nothing more than a timestamp of what you believe at the moment. Don’t be scared to write boldly about something you believe in at the time, only to change your mind later. Don’t be afraid to look a little foolish in the short term to achieve mastery in the long term.
- Aim to be great, fall short, do it again, fall a bit less short, and do it again. Do this your entire life and you’re a real writer.
- View the early works of your heroes and compare them to their current work to see the difference. Embrace shitty writing. Refine your raw talent.

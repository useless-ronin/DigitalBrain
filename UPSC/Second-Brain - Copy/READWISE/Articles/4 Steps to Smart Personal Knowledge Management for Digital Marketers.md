## Highlights
- Personal knowledge management is taking over the internet.
- It’s different from how most of us currently collect digital information, which could more accurately be described as hoarding — accumulating hundreds of bookmarked articles, highlighted book passages, and jotted down statistics
- What is Personal Knowledge Management?
- Personal knowledge management is the concept of creating a process or system for collecting and storing information for future use, particularly for writing or content creation.
- The ultimate capture goal is to have a way to easily save these things, no matter where you come across them. Don’t worry about adding detail. You can organize and filter them later.
- Digital hoarding doesn’t help you use the information you’re collecting; it makes it harder.
- involves creating systems, adding your own context, and making information easy to surface when you need to reference
- But regardless of what popular framework you use (or whether you use one at all), there are a few steps you’ll want to make sure your personal knowledge management system includes:
- Capturing information and ideas as you find them.
  Processing them to add your own context.
  Incubating the ideas until you need them.
  Using them to create new things.
- Step 1. Capture Ideas and Information
- Step 3: Incubate Your Ideas
- By making things easy to capture, you can keep it without taking you away from whatever you’re doing at the time.
- Processing is when you go through your inboxes and deal with everything you’ve saved recently, adding enough context that Future-You will be able to find it and use it when you need it.
- Step 2. Process and Add Your Own Context
- As you process pieces of information, you can:
  Delete anything you don’t find useful or relevant anymore.
  Add notes to your future self to create context (why you saved something, what you like about it, which parts you want to use later and for what, etc.).
  Add metadata like tags to make searching and filtering your PKM system easier.
- Then, you’ll move the information from your inbox to wherever it should be stored more long-term.
- Once you have things organized, you’ll want to let them sit there. Leave them be.
- When you’re actively engaging with an idea, like organizing it in your PKM system, you’re making new connections for your brain.
- Your brain then needs time to passively process those connections and draw conclusions from them.
- If you’ve ever had an “aha!” moment while doing something completely unrelated to your work, that was the incubation effect at work.
- Step 4: Create New Things

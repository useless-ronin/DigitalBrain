# Highlights 
feature: you used to be only to tap the ‘heart’ button once. I was here pre-partner program. That’s right. I wrote articles on Medium, gasp, for free.  ^278320159

---

I’ve earned the right to write about writing and to write about Medium since I’ve been here longer than all of  ^278320160

---

Medium doesn’t owe you a damn thing. It’s a for-profit business, not a charity. Nobody owes you their attention either. There’s this belief among new writers, hell even experienced ones, that people should read your writing just because you wrote it.  ^278320161

---

market always decides.  ^278320162

---

I’ve been banging the keyboard for the better portion of a decade. I’ve done the work. You need to do the work.  ^278320163

---

Back in 2012, you could throw up garbage articles, jam them with keywords, and rank number one on Google. Those days are gone, so everyone pronounced SEO dead  ^278320164

---

being an early adopter to a platform makes things easier, but a platform maturing doesn’t mean you can’t be successful on it.  ^278320165

---

figure out the basics of how the platforms work and create your best quality work.  ^278320166

---

you become a hack the minute you start trying to game the algorithm.  ^278320167

---

don’t try to game the algorithm. Write good stuff.  ^278320168

---

The new guard that makes it on Medium is always a small handful of writers among the massive wave of newbies that come in. It’s always been that way.  ^278320169

---

Most new writers won’t change their strategy if they’re not getting views. They’ll keep writing stuff no one wants to read  ^278320170

---

Most new writers don’t write enough. You don’t have to publish every day. But you should be working on your craft every single day.  ^278320171

---

Success is always going to go to the few instead of the many. Just the way things work. Become one of the few.  ^278320172

---

Keep 70% of content with a few comfortable topics while expanding with experimental stuff in the outer 30% (with 10% being the most off-the-wall  ^278320173

---

self-help, relationship advice, satire, fiction, business profiles, history, personal essays, you name it.  ^278320174

---

And instead of coming up with their own style, other writers just tried to copy him.  ^278320175

---

there’s more of an emphasis on building a connection with your readers. I don’t see a problem with that at all. I’m game.  ^278320176

---

Be an active participant  ^278320177

---

I pay attention to what topics seem to rise to the surface. Again, the point isn’t to game the algorithm, but to be aware.  ^278320178

---

Maybe try getting your information directly from the horse’s mouth.  ^278320179

---

Imagine wanting to make money without investing in yourself.  ^278320180

---

You write self-improvement content but hide in a corner when you’re not getting the results you want? Makes zero sense.  ^278320181

---

Right now is your time to decide. Are you going to keep writing while so many are complaining? Or will you fold like most people tend to do in life?  ^278320182

---

I’m still going to be here making great money and building a writing business I love.  ^278320183

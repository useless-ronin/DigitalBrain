# Highlights 
most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth  ^278319751

---

They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.  ^278319752

---

many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.  ^278319753

---

what if you placed a high value on your time?  ^278319754

---

Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.  ^278319755

---

Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.  ^278319756

---

“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss  ^278319757

---

Most people have no clue what they are doing with their time but still complain that they don’t have enough  ^278319758

---

If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.  ^278319759

---

This is how lives are wasted — by doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place.  ^278319760

---

“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”  ^278319761

---

When you’re busy, you are on autopilot. You can’t see the hours slipping away, time you’ll never get back.  ^278319762

---

But for most people, this “busyness” is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters. They just like feeling busy.  ^278319763

---

They’re a sign you’re off-track  ^278319764

---

Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.  ^278319765

---

Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”  ^278319766

---

Then cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do.If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.  ^278319767

---

You teach people how to treat you.  ^278319768

---

if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.  ^278319769

---

If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired.  ^278319770

---

. I began saying “no” to almost everything. I had a mission, and I became unwilling to fill my valuable time with things that wouldn’t help me achieve my goal.  ^278319771

---

Treat your time as a valuable commodity, and people will begin to treat it like that, too.  ^278319772

---

The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet  ^278319773

---

Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities  ^278319774

---

People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things  ^278319775

---

Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?  ^278319776

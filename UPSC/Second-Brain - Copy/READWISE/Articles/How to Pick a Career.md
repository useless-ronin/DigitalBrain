## Highlights
- it’s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today.
- How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)
- Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are—which is weird because I’m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this
- Your Life Path So Far
- We’re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be
- Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO.
- no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path—except you.
- chef eventually writes a new recipe.
- Who am I?” and “What are the important things in life?” and “What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?”
- most of us also don’t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn’t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.
- When scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I
- reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist.
- Being a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy—which makes sense, because you’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you’re trying to invent it for the first time
- Our job isn’t to think about our path—it’s to succeed on the path we’ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for
- reasoning by analogy—happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there—kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.
- childhood is kind of like a river, and we’re kind of like tadpoles.
- Impact
- Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.
- Time
- Quality of Life
- One group of people will look at the map and see a big, stressful question mark.
- your career path is a work in progress.
- All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future—but the kind of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy.
- you’re left with 250,000 “meaningful adult hours.”3 So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time—not something to be a cook about.
- Identity
- clothes aren’t important to me, and they’re not how I choose to express my individuality. So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.2
- The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you’re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.
- Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky.
- a person’s career quadruples as the person’s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.
- The lucky ones feel they know where they want to go and believe they’re marching in that direction.
- This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval.
- we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who’s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us.
- you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it’ll specifically mean going directly against others. The Want Box is a game of compromise.
- The Personal Yearnings tentacle is probably the hardest one to generalize here—it’s pretty particular to each of us.
- The Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box
- The Yearning Octopus
- the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected.
- “Who actually drew this arrow? Was it really me?” The answer can get confusing.
- you want a bunch of different things—or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants—and fears—its own stuff.
- In the cook-chef post, I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices. At its core is a simple Venn diagram.
- An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person—who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.
- a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly.
- For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down.
- the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment
- Deep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Box
- Other people will see a nice clear arrow representing a direction they feel confident is right—but find their legs walking in a different direction
- Your practical tentacle also can’t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person
- that its owner isn’t you
- The Moral Yearnings tentacle
- Or when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still.
- While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to deploy.
- It’s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you’re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It’s probably a parent.)
- The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing;
- The Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day
- It’s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible
- It’s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are.
- The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys.
- More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.
- even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it’s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time
- not doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles—the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem
- your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn’t really care how these things happen—it just wants them to happen.
- Practical Yearnings tentacle
- when you do something philanthropic—or anything altruistic, really—there are a few separate things going on in your head.
- your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus—that’s why you’ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.
- The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn’t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.
- some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner,
- there’s your ego, who’s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn’t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon
- the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to show that person or those people who never believed in them.
- Dissecting the Octopus
- each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other.
## New highlights added June 26, 2022 at 9:05 PM
- Maybe it’s the heavy weight of inertia—an intense resistance to change—that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings.
- The cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house.
- Perhaps you don’t really think it’s fear of failure that’s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it’s a dread of the change in identity—both internally and externally—that inevitably accompanies a career move like thi
- Only by digging into our mind’s subconscious can we see what’s really going on.
- We can go look at it anytime—we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement,
- The answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity
- You’ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy.
- You never stopped to ask yourself whether your own accumulated wisdom actually justifies the level of conviction you feel about that core belief.
- realize that you never really thought to consider whether you actually independently agree with it.
- Searching for Imposters
- Desires, beliefs, values, and fears don’t materialize out of nowhere. They’re either developed over time by our internal consciousness as observations and life experience pour in, or they’re implanted in us from the outside, by someone else.

## New highlights added August 31, 2022 at 8:57 PM
- Reframing a bunch of career paths in your mind will affect your level of yearning for some of them
- an audit will leave them feeling like they have a lot more options than they realized, empowering them to set their sights on a bolder direction.
- Connecting the Dots into the Future
- going from a false arrow to a question mark is always major progress in life.
- a new list of options on the table that seem both desirable to your high-priority rankings and possible to achieve.
- One career may seem less appealing after reminding yourself that it will entail thousands of hours of networking or multiple decades of pre-success struggle.
- Today’s careers—especially the less traditional ones—are really really not like tunnels
- The truth is, careers have probably never really functioned like 40-year-tunnels, they just seemed that way. At best, traditional careers of the past played out kind of like tunnels.
- getting to know yourself and getting to know the world. Major step in the right direction.
- Careers used to be kind of like a 40-year tunnel. You picked your tunnel, and once you were in, that was that. You worked in that profession for 40 years or so before the tunnel spit you out on the other side into your retirement.

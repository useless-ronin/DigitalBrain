# Highlights 
The focus is usually on a writing platform rather than writing itself. This leads innocent advice-givers to drift into the realm of fortune-telling.  ^278320061

---

When your mind is full, dump your thoughts onto a page — especially if there’s something you can’t stop thinking about. When your mind is empty, fill it up with books  ^278320062

---

It’s called** best selling** author, not best-writing author — Robert Kiyosaki  ^278320063

---

Throw your English degree in the bin. The writers who can package ideas into stories that sell the message win every time  ^278320064

---

90% of what they have to offer is free.  ^278320065

---

If you seek to earn a living as a writer then follow the $0 strategy. Write as much content as you can for free without the paywall. Only put up a paywall between you and the reader when your bills stop getting paid. Short-term pain for long-term writing growth.  ^278320066

---

Sitting down with a blank page is the worst idea in the world. What I do is write headlines and a few dot points a couple of days in advance. I can always scratch what I’ve pre-prepared, but at least I have something more beautiful than a butt-ugly blank page.  ^278320067

---

When you do you’ll stop people in their tracks and create a mountain of comments.  ^278320068

---

The purpose of writing isn’t to have people agree with you. It’s to make people think. Do that and you’ll be unstoppable as a writer.  ^278320069

---

The platform is not the problem. It’s you. —  ^278320070

---

No social media app is constantly changing its algorithm every day to screw with your writing. Throw the tarot cards in the bin.  ^278320071

---

When views drop, increase quality, decrease excuses.  ^278320072

---

Writing is 50% thinking, 5% typing, 45% deleting the bad parts.Get to — and I cannot stress this enough — the point.  ^278320073

---

Especially cut the throats of words like “really, potentially, and actually.” They’re weak as piss.  ^278320074

---

A lot of it is about loneliness. We sit in our house writing blog posts and then hit Publish  ^278320075

---

People are vastly underestimating the demand for intelligent, high-quality writing on the Internet — David Perell  ^278320076

---

there is … and most of it sucks. You’ve got to scroll for hours on some platforms to find one good article.  ^278320077

---

Work on the quality of your writing and most of the common problems will magically disappear, like the teeth the tooth fairy takes away when you’re a kid.  ^278320078

---

There’s no such thing as writer’s block. There’s simply a fear of bad writing. Do enough bad writing and some good writing is bound to show up. — Seth  ^278320079

---

Sit down. Write a few bad sentences. Keep writing till it gets good  ^278320080

---

Don’t under-research either. If you sit down with no pre-prepared ideas and zero research, you’re going to get your face ripped off. Write down ten headlines two days before. Use them when you sit down to write.  ^278320081

---

Once you get into writing, it takes over your brain and your fingers hit the keyboard.  ^278320082

---

How to build a mini traffic machine as a writer:— Write one article every week (SEO)— Repurpose it as a thread (social)— Send it to your list (email)— Post it in relevant communities (referrals)Create once  ^278320083

---

Alternating between single-sentence paragraphs and multi-sentence paragraphs is the fastest way to make your writing more accessible.If the headline and the first sentence and the subheads all hook their attention, they start to read. — Nicolas Cole  ^278320084

---

Personal stories that start with a killer opening line outperform everything  ^278320085

---

brain-busting first sentence followed by a personal story can hook you for 6–8 minutes without a problem.  ^278320086

---

Light a fire inside before writing  ^278320087

---

Feel fire before you write. Or don’t do it.I don’t write an article until I’m feeling it! I need to feel fire about what I’m saying because I’m trying to light that same fire in my readers. Until I feel that fire, I don’t hit publish. — Benjamin Hardy  ^278320088

---

Bring your energy levels up with music or exercise before you dare talk to readers and take up their time.  ^278320089

---

Man, the angle you choose to write from is what makes you different.”  ^278320090

---

Don’t pick the obvious angle to every story. Otherwise, you sound like a cliche writer that will drown in a sea of similar writing. No need to get fancy. Just choose a bizarre angle.  ^278320091

## Highlights
- The hardest part about being an online writer is building a consistent and sustainable writing habit
- Writing one post every few months is easy enough, but how about incorporating daily writing into your life in an enjoyable and productive way? (versus a struggle and constant source of I-should-be-doing-more-guilt!)
- All it takes is a system, a step-by-step framework you can blindly follow when you sit down to write.
- You want to spend your precious energy on writing, not on making decisions or getting distracted by yet another how-to-go-viral guide
- After 10 months of writing online, Iâ€™ve cobbled together my own system by cherry-picking the best ideas and concepts from several writing workshops and, yes â€” how-to-go guides ðŸ˜‰.
- Writing Phases
- The most demoralising thing you can do, especially as a beginner writer, is to start with a blank page and force yourself to publish something that same day.
- now treat writing as a process and break it down into clearly defined phases with distinct tasks and objectives spread over multiple days.
- best writers to start with a Shitty First Draft, and avoid writing and editing simultaneously.
- If you donâ€™t plan your time, someone else will. â€” Nir Eyal
- Calendar Blocking
- Thereâ€™s always something more urgent and more important that needs your attention.
- If you want to commit to writing daily, you have to protect that writing time like a lion protects its cubs. Calendar Blocking is the best productivity system I have found to do that.
- WritingLog
- We do not learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on experience. â€” John Dewey
- The WritingLog is a simple tracker to reflect after every writing session on what went well, what you can do better next time and the plan for the following days.
- Articles Tracker
- itâ€™s helpful to have a system where you can keep track of the status of each article â€” depending on the writing phase youâ€™re in.
- By moving it from phase to phase, youâ€™ll ensure that you donâ€™t forget a step â€” like posting on Twitter, following up with a Publication, or updating the SEO settings.
- Upper/Lower Bound & Habit Tracking
- Forcing yourself to write every day can get overwhelming. You always feel like you havenâ€™t done enough.

# Highlights 
I love the optimism, encouragement, and tangible tips. But, I haven’t actually taken these tips to heart. I read, highlight on my Kindle, and think “wow, I should do that!”  ^278319956

It’s common to read self-improvement books without ever taking any action toward improvement. Instead, we believe we’re bettering ourselves by absorbing the author’s intention but never acting.  ^278319957

It’s time to take action and stop procrastinating.  ^278319958

Motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure.” —  ^278319959

Everyone is scared of failure, but taking the risk of failure is how we learn. If you never translate your motion into action, you will never truly learn.  ^278319960

Instead of putting pen to paper, I catch myself reading books on writing tips or signing up for courses on how to write better. I never actually practice.  ^278319961

putting in the reps — is the most important part of improving yourself  ^278319962

Once you’ve identified the goal you want to reach or the thing you finally want to do, create a small step to get started  ^278319964

---

Take a five-minute walk around a different part of your neighborhood every day. See the world through new eyes.  ^278319965

---

These small actions establish consistency, forcing your brain to get used to making your goals a reality. Don’t just read books about programming, watch exercise videos, or pine for faraway destinations. Choose action over motion.  ^278319966

---

you’ll never be ready. Taking on a new challenge means growing while doing it. After taking action, you’ll be more prepared for the next challenge  ^278319967

---

If you wait until you’re fully prepared, you’ll never take action.Be okay with the imperfect, and do the thing anyway  ^278319968

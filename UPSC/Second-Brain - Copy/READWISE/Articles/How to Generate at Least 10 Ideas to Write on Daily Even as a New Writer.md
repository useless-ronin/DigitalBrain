## Highlights
- Write out five topics you have learned about in the past two years and five problems you have been able to solve or overcome in your life over the past two years.
- Have a separate journal for quotes. On days that it seems like you have nothing to write about, browse through your quote journal and stick with the first quote that jumps at you. As you think about it, insights will begin to flow.
- 1. Keep a Story Sheet:
- Now write an article targetting people who are currently in the position you were in two years ago, helping them with your story and all you learned in the process.
- Devote five minutes before your bedtime to pick one moment throughout the entire day that stands out and why.
- Every time you read a quote that hits home, donâ€™t just nod. File it.
- Doing this daily gives you a database of personal experiences to pick from and write.
- You only need one idea to write one article per day. Right?
- 4. Read Daily:
- Write out that moment in very few words.
- 2. The 2 Years Test:
- A story sheet can be an excel sheet (I recommend that) or a regular journal, where you store stories daily.
- 3. Quotes Filing:
- One of the reasons many refuse to write is because they fear that they do not have enough ideas and insights to share.
- Read every day. Meaningful content. Your reading should be planned, not reactive.

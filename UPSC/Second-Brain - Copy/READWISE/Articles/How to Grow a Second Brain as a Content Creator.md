## Highlights
- 10 years from now, having a second brain will be expected of you
- The great paradox of technology is that it has made our lives more efficient than ever, but it also makes us lose a ton of time with notifications we don’t need, emails we don’t read, and ads that suck away our attention.
- we’ll take a look at more possible solutions to the digital chaos of the 21st century, again from a content creation perspective.
- “Content is King”. In the online world, you have a split second to catch somebody’s attention with a great title, an awesome image, or a shocking number
- technology is moving incredibly fast. 10 years ago Facebook was the attention-sucking king. People were spending 17 minutes per day on the social network on average, and nobody thought it was possible to do “better”. Now there’s Tiktok, and people spend an average of 52 minutes per day on it. 2.65 billion people in the world use social media, and nobody knows what company will set the bar higher to distract us even more.
- The problem with content research and writing is that even if you have 5x more focus than the next guy and 10x more motivation, you’ll still most likely end up in the same place: lost in the depths of the internet.
- expectations on quality are getting higher than ever, whether for blog posts, research papers, corporate reports, social media infographics… As we said in the previous part, all of this is only going to get faster. If it’s hard for you to imagine, you need to seriously reconsider your approach to technology, otherwise you’ll get left behind.
- It won’t even matter if your watch or your phone is with you, because your boss’ email will show up in your field of view, on a mini screen embedded in your contact lenses/glasses. Or maybe some AI voice will read it out loud for you through the ear microchip you got for Christmas
- with technology, adapt or die.
- There’s nothing we can do to stop the flow of new things because it’s a natural part of evolution. The craziest part about this is that 90% of the new stuff won’t even last in the long term, but we have to go through it to improve
- We create more tools that won’t matter anymore in 5 or 10 years, we begin to lose information, documents and files are left behind, important resources get lost in email chains and cloud servers.
- 1. Have as few tools as possible in your digital life
- 2. More tools don’t mean more productivity
- 3. Knowledge networking is the future of content creation and research

## Highlights
- LinkedIn has many dark secrets.One of the biggest questions is how money gets made on the platform. A reader asked me.
- Unlike Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, LinkedIn has avoided controversy. Most people like it and don’t think it’s some evil tech play
- LinkedIn is this way because ads don’t drive the business — premium memberships do.
- The user base is full of professionals too. And I know I shouldn’t push this point too much, but the average salary of users is enormous, so high-end advertisers see it as a place to get a decent ROI. Creators feel the same.
- Many platforms now pay content creators directly by splitting ad or subscription revenue. You might think this is a good thing. I don’t.
- It’s made creators lazy. They’ve become entitled. They think their content that takes one hour to produce is worth 6-figures. LOL. It’s not.
- LinkedIn doesn’t pay creators (yet).
- to make money on LinkedIn you need to bridge the gap between your content, and a website or marketplace that enables people to spend money on your products/services.
- How to bridge the gapAnswer: use creativity
- Many wannabe creators never make money on platforms like LinkedIn because they’re not creative enough. Let me explain.
- You post your content on LinkedIn. Users see it. They read it. They might ‘like’ or comment. But that’s it. You have no easy way to bring them to your website or get them onto Amazon to buy your book
- Place links to your landing pages in the first comment.Place a link to your landing pages in the featured section of your profile.Place a link to your landing pages in your bio.
- Social media followers are useless. Linking to a website is stupid because it gives a user too many options. The only thing to ever link to is a landing page with one button: subscribe. Otherwise, making money on LinkedIn will never happen.
- Notice how I didn’t say “link to a landing page that sells a product.” This is strategic. If you link straight to a page where you ask for money, you lose.
- Who likes to be asked to get married on the first date?No. One. In. History.
- You only want people to come to your email list. They need to be nurtured gently before they’ll ever spend money with you
- you can only link to ONE thing. The moment you link to more than one thing you kill any chance of success. You have to remove decision fatigue for users and give them one option, or you’ll lose them.
- The call to action you use has to be written well. It has to sell the huge benefit to the user of why they must click your link right now. If it’s not a phenomenal reason, nobody clicks. Period.
- the call to action has to be related to the piece of content it’s connected to.
- Just telling people to join your email list doesn’t work
- They need to be given a reason to join your email list that relates back to the content they just read.
- That’s not intuitive. I rarely see it done. Yet my LinkedIn friend Justin gets hundreds of subscribers from one post because he understands this nuance.
- A landing page takes a user to a lead magnet, which is a fancy way of saying, they get something for free — course, eBook, template, video — in return for joining your email list.
- Lead magnets
- But if I link an article about the US economy to an eBook I wrote about investing money then it makes sense, so the conversion rate will be at least 10X higher.Context is everything.
- One tip I’ve recently used to 3X the results
- Change your call-to-actions (CTAs) regularly.
- The same CTA — “Join my email list” — used over and over eventually gets ignored. But when you spice up your CTAs and have a library of them, everything changes. Suddenly the number of email subscribers you get from CTA links placed in your bio, comments, and featured section goes up!!!
- Once you bridge the gap between LinkedIn and your own ecosystem your email list will grow. Now all you have to do is make money from it. Again, it needs creativity.If what you sell is low quality, fail.If how you market what you sell is poor, fail.If what you sell is priced incorrectly, fail.If what you sell is crap, fail.Creativity is needed at every step. A learning mindset followed by clever iteration is needed, too.
- Now to how money gets made from an email list built from LinkedIn…
- Consulting — LinkedIn is such an easy way to get consulting gigs. People will observe your work over time and eventually ask for help. The help they’re asking for is consulting in disguise. Answer questions. When you feel they want you to do the work for them, say “I do consulting.” This is the secret handshake that says I can charge to do it for you.eBooks — Launch a book. Sell it to your email list.Newsletters — Professionals love niche publications. They’re happy to pay for them because either their work covers the cost, or they get a tax deduction for buying them. Use Substack if you don’t want a clusterf*ck.Courses — If you publish non-fiction content on LinkedIn, there will always be 5% of the audience that wants to learn from you. Sell them a course. Use Teachable or Gumroad to facilitate it.Public speaking — This is more unique to LinkedIn. Businesses love to have speakers talk to staff or join them for events. You’ll get LinkedIn direct messages or emails from those on your email list to do them for cash.Memberships — Free communities are trash. It ends up becoming an uncurated feed of ads followed by b*tch fights. LinkedIn users are smart. They’re happy to pay for memberships to niche communities. Start one.In-direct job promotions — Despite everything I’ve said you can do none of it. I made my first $10,000 on LinkedIn by getting a promotion at work because a manager liked my LinkedIn content. That’s cool too.
- Takeaway
- Getting directly paid by platforms for content is overrated. It makes great creators with loads of potential, lazy.
- Use LinkedIn to publish content. Then bridge the gap between LinkedIn and your email list with creativity. Focus on the nuances. Then use an obvious way to charge for what you do to make money on LinkedIn.

- Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.
- Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks.
- When you get invited to something in the future, ask yourself, Would I do this tomorrow?
- The thing that made you weird as a kid could make you great as an adult
- It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse.
- Ignore what they are thinking of you because they are not thinking of you.
- Something does not need to be perfect to be wonderful, especially weddings.
- The biggest lie we tell ourselves is, “I don’t need to write this down because I will remember it.”
- A friend shares the advice: “Always make the call. If you’re disturbed or confused by something somebody did, always pick up the phone.”
- A search around the world of online advice givers uncovers some other diamonds of practical wisdom, both prosaic and profound:
- Job interviews are not really about you. They are about the employer’s needs and how you can fill them.
- If you can’t make up your mind between two options, flip a coin. Don’t decide based on which side of the coin came up. Decide based on your emotional reaction to which side came up.
- Take photos of things your parents do every day. That’s how you’ll want to remember them.
- Build identity capital. In your 20s do three fascinating things that job interviewers and dinner companions will want to ask you about for the rest of your life.
- Marriage is a 50-year conversation. Marry someone you want to talk with for the rest of your life.
- If you’re giving a speech, be vulnerable. Fall on the audience members and let them catch you. They will.
- When you’re beginning a writing project, give yourself permission to write badly. You can’t fix it until it’s down on paper.
- Make the day; don’t let the day make you. Make sure you are setting your schedule, not just responding to invitations from others
- If you meet a jerk once a month, you’ve met a jerk. If you meet jerks every day, you’re a jerk.
- Don’t try to figure out what your life is about. It’s too big a question. Just figure out what the next three years are about.
- . If you follow the life hacks above, you may not wind up as rich as he is, but you may wind up as serene.

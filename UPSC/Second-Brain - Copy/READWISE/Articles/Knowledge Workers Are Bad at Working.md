## Highlights
- represents a huge opportunity for knowledge workers. If you can adopt a culture of systematic improvement, similar to what’s common in other skilled fields, you can potentially accelerate your career far beyond your inbox-dwelling, discomfort-avoiding peers (and cultivate passion for your livelihood in the process).
- Deep Work (v.1)
- Knowledge workers dedicate too much time to shallow work — tasks that almost anyone, with a minimum of training, could accomplish (e-mail replies, logistical planning, tinkering with social media, and so on).
- it’s easy, which makes use feel productive
- But this type of work is ultimately empty. We cannot find real satisfaction in efforts that are easily replicatable, nor can we expect such efforts to be the foundation of a remarkable career

- deep work — cognitively demanding activities that leverage our training to generate rare and valuable results, and that push our abilities to continually improve.
- Step #1: Prepare
- easier to convince your mind to do the first step of a simple ritual than to dive straight into intense contemplation
- Our brains are stingy when it comes to expending energy, so you shouldn’t expect to casually switch over to a deep work mindset
- Step #2: Clarify
- A hazy goal is not enough to sustain your concentration at the needed levels.
- When you tackle this chunk, push for a result that is beyond — but not too far beyond — what’s comfortable for your current skill level.
- Step #3: Stretch
- Finding chunks that require stretch, but are not so hard that you get permanently blocked, is non-trivival, but is also something that will improve with practice
- Step #4: Obsess
- The nice thing about deep work is that it’s a clear state of mind. You begin a session with a well-defined ritual, you work on a stretch chunk for 1 – 3 hours, then you finish and go rest

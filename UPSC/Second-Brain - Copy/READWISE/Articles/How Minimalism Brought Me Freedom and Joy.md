# Highlights 
I have one bag of clothes, one backpack with a computer, iPad, and phone. I have zero other possessions.  ^278319883

---

don’t like that word. I live the way I like to live no matter what label it has.  ^278319884

---

At any moment, you are exactly where you want to be, for better or worse.  ^278319885

---

like to be a wanderer. Without knowing where I am going to end up. To explore with no goal. To love without expectation.  ^278319886

---

I think minimalism means having as little as you require. That means different things to everyone.  ^278319887

---

My brain is not so big. So now I can think about other things. I can explore other ways of living more easily.  ^278319888

---

At 48 years old I have nothing and nowhere. Other than the people I love and the experiences I love.  ^278319889

---

Yes. I’ve worked harder for other things since then. I don’t keep all of these things around either. They are gone.  ^278319890

---

Society tells us a diploma is a special life achievement. It isn’t. It’s yesterday. I don’t hold onto all the things society tells me to hold onto  ^278319891

---

I’m not minimalist if minimalism means having zero attachments. I’m attached to my kids.  ^278319892

---

Do you have to get off the internet to be a minimalist?”  ^278319893

---

I have 238,795 unread emails in my inbox. Emails are a suggestion but not an obligation.  ^278319894

---

Love and spirituality and gratitude are found in personal connection. Not in an email response.  ^278319895

---

I never answer the phone. I have no voicemail. My phone number is 203–512–2161. Try it and see.  ^278319896

---

I understand real books are beautiful. So I go to bookstores for hours and read them. But I won’t own them because they won’t fit in my one bag.  ^278319897

---

I never read random articles on the Internet unless they are by people I know. Mostly I read books I love.  ^278319898

---

aren’t you afraid you’re going to miss some information?”  ^278319899

---

99% of information we read, we forget anyway. The best way to remember is to “DO.”  ^278319900

---

Minimalism of things? No. Minimalism of fear, anxiety, stress, mourning.  ^278319901

---

don’t like any intrigue. I don’t like to gossip about people.  ^278319902

---

don’t like feeling bad if someone doesn’t like me. That’s also baggage. I try to leave that behind.  ^278319903

---

If anything, the more you accomplish, the more you can afford to get rid of the things society uses to hold you down.  ^278319904

---

experiences are always more important than material goods. A story is more important than a gift.  ^278319905

---

A material good might not fit in my bag. But a joyful experience is lighter than an atom.  ^278319906

---

What if an experience is not so joyful.One thing I know: joy is a choice inside and not an emotion given to you.  ^278319907

---

You have to have goals to succeed! How can you be a minimalist with goals  ^278319908

---

have interests and things that I love to do. If I get better at those things each day (or try to) I feel good.  ^278319909

---

When I have less things in my bag, I feel more free. Did I get 1% more “free” today, whatever free means?  ^278319910

---

Figure out the 10–15 things you want in your bag before you die tomorrow.  ^278319911

---

But there’s one thing I can do: I can always help someone else. That makes my day and life lighter.  ^278319912

---

Anyone can have miracles in their life.Miracles don’t happen. Miracles are given  ^278319913

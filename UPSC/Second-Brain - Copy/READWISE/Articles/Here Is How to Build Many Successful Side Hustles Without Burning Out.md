# Highlights 
How can one person build a blog, a podcast, write articles for other online journals, make online courses, write a newsletter, and also have time to spend with their family and friends?  ^278319208

---

They don’t. Which is the answer in most cases. Or they have a secret.  ^278319209

---

The power of repetition  ^278319210

---

our brain gets better with repetition  ^278319211

---

when we memorize new things, our brain passes through two phases. In the first phase, we transfer the data from the external world into our short-term memory. But then, we need another process to pass that data from the short-term to the long-term memory.This second part, the most important one, can happen in three ways: urgency, association, and repetition.Urgency  ^278319212

---

UrgencyUrgency deals with threats to our integrity. When our body feels threatened, it memorizes the information that can prevent that feeling and remembers it for a long time, potentially our entire life.  ^278319213

---

AssociationAssociation deals with the power of our brain to learn things by analyzing things it already knows. This is because our brain tries to be efficient, so if there is a shortcut to remember something without building more neural links, it will do it.  ^278319214

---

RepetitionRepetition is the most solid learning technique because it chemically builds connections between our neurons, and those are physical links harder to break. Our brain often uses this learning type to acquire new skills that become hard-wired to our behavior once we master them.  ^278319215

---

you want to build many successful side hustles, you need to use the most robust learning technique at your disposal: repetition.  ^278319216

---

Side hustles are minor jobs you can do in your free time  ^278319217

---

when you try to make a regular job out of those side hustles, you have two options: increase the output, or build different projects.  ^278319218

---

Repetition allows you to reach side hustle mastery.Side hustle mastery leads to a higher income.A huge income opens the doors to collaborations and hirings.The possibility to defer jobs leads to more free time.And free time allows you to start new side hustles.  ^278319219

---

repetition is your strongest ally  ^278319220

---

And all you need is to keep going until that chemical connection creates in your brain.  ^278319221

---

At first, you won’t be good at your new job, and it will take your hours to finish it. But after a couple of times, your brain starts automating simple actions, and you get faster  ^278319222

---

if your income doesn’t improve, you need to start using other strategies because your current ones are ineffective  ^278319223

---

Whatever you do, never blame the idea. Most of the time, you just didn’t use the most efficient tools to find your niche.  ^278319224

---

Once your income grows, invest your money to grow your business,  ^278319225

---

The important thing is that you start acting more like a leader, a CEO, and less like an employee.  ^278319226

---

In content creation, for example, many people hire editors to edit their videos or articles. And with this simple action, you double your free time or even better  ^278319227

---

More free time allows you to start new side hustles.  ^278319228

---

you will enjoy that free time as an exquisite pleasure, but after a while, if you have a side-hustle-focused mentality, you will get bored. And you will mingle with the idea of starting a new side hustle.  ^278319229

---

Your new project could be an addition to your previous side hustle or a completely different thing, but you will do it. In the first case, your brain will already have some connections that will help you succeed faster. While in the second case, you will have to deal with repetition once again.  ^278319230

---

Free time leads to boredom, and boredom leads to great projects.  ^278319231

---

Without repetition, you won’t ever master anything in your life. And without collaboration, each of your projects won’t ever scale and surpass your free time threshold.  ^278319232

repetition and collaboration  ^278319233

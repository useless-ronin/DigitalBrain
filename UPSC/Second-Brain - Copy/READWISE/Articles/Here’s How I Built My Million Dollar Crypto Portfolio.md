## Highlights
- Invest every payday
- Crypto has made a lot of normies stupidly rich.
- Every time I get paid I buy some crypto. I’ve had this philosophy since the early days. There’s nothing better than investing money in your future.
- Habits create millionaires. Start a crypto investing habit
- Invest heavily when markets are down
- A recession is likely based on all the typical indicators, such as the inverted yield curve. Inflation is out of control, and politics looks like a sh*t show.
- This is when most people don’t invest. In 2017 crypto markets fell by, in some cases, 80% or more. All hope was lost. The critics said crypto would be banned. I believed them and did nothing. I stopped looking at my portfolio because it made me feel stupid.
- Despite all the drama, when prices fell off a cliff I saw it as discount season. Excess money in the system normally leads to higher prices. Sure enough, the markets went into euphoria. So did crypto prices. A blind monkey could bet on a crypto and make a profit.
- When there’s fear in the streets it’s the best time to load up on crypto. That time is now.
- Avoid hype
- The hype about this crypto or that can quickly ignite your FOMO. I made money in crypto by staying away from hype.
- one of the worst ways to be hyped into a scam is through celebrities. If Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian or Dan Bilzerian is talking about a crypto, run for the hills.
- The way I got ahead of the crypto market and all the silly influencers was through research. I went deep on different cryptos. I have done my 10,000 hours worth of research since 2013.
- How to one-up the entire crypto market
- Opinions are like butt cracks … everyone has one.
- Most cryptos don’t solve a problem and that’s the problem. And most cryptos are businesses with zero revenue. Few understand
- Stick to the top ten
- One mistake many amateurs make is investing in small cryptos that likely won’t make it.
- No intention of selling
- When you buy real estate as an investment you don’t generally sell. Instead you borrow money against your house to buy another property. The same will apply to crypto soon.
- My plan is to borrow money against my crypto to buy a house. The crypto will act as collateral or a deposit. These products are coming soon.
- The advantage is when you hold onto your crypto you don’t have to pay capital gains tax, and you get to keep your crypto that will continue to appreciate as the market matures.
- 5-year timeframes
- I never invested in crypto to get-rich-quick. I prefer to make money slowly.
- Trading in and out of crypto markets is a suckers’ game. Don’t do it.
- Research. Buy. Hold. Borrow against your crypto.
- Have a beautifully open mind
- The internet is full of critics and skeptics.
- Small bets
- If all you do is invest in stable, bluechip cryptos you’ll limit your upside. I believe crypto investors should mix in a few smaller bets
- Many of these may not make it through the bear market but some will. And small cryptos can gain traction and become leaders in their niche. When they do, unfair profits get made.
- Back a few cryptos for fun
- As a result I also invest to have fun. I bought some Ape Coin recently to support the Bored Ape Yacht Club Metaverse, and I’m going to buy a kickass NFT to use on Web3 social media (when that exists).
- Play money in crypto is how you learn. No point having a million-dollar crypto portfolio if you’re not having fun.Closing Thought
- Once you understand crypto, you have one of the greatest opportunities in history to invest during this bear market while crypto prices are on discount.

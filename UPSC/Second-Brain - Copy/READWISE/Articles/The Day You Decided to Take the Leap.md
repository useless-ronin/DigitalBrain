## Highlights
- reaching one’s potential is deeply embedded in all of u
- The reason why babies are so cherished is because of all the bright possibilities that await them; every life path is open, and the world is their oyster
- For a moment, no door is closed, and we take joy in seeing them maneuver through a seemingly infinite existence, figuring out what resonates with them and what doesn’t.
- As a human being grows into adulthood, however, things shift. Whereas an infant goes through the world with curiosity, an adult is expected to move about with justification.
- Life choices must be made with analysis, and interestingly, even inaction requires this type of reasoning as well.
- the justified mind is one that understands loss aversion – one that wouldn’t want to trade the comfort and safety of the present moment for an uncertain and rocky future.
- This is why when someone takes the leap in a professional setting, we dub this phenomenon as “following your passion” instead of “following your rationality.”
- Trying to fulfill one’s potential may seem like in a pie-in-the-sky, utopian concept, but it’s become increasingly clear to me that it’s the most sensical thing to do once you frame it in the proper light
- While you can easily predict the concerns of making any leap, there is no way to predict the numerous rewards that await you on the other side.
- This story does a good job revealing the fundamental asymmetry behind the two sides:
- the most rational thing to do is to actually make the jump.
- By not making that leap, you are voting to give up all unimaginable future rewards for a single concern you can predict and prepare for today.
- The Asymmetry Is Everywhere
- the most important jumps have little to do with our jobs, and more to do with our growth as a human being.
- And sure, doing fulfilling work contributes to that cause, but it’s just one of many parts of our identities that require a move into a higher realm.
- This asymmetry is everywhere
- It exists in the person who was scared to publish personal essays in fear of ridicule, but decided to take the leap and do it anyway. He will learn over time that while the fear of rejection may persist, all the benefits he accumulated in the form of new relationships and opportunities were once unthinkable, yet now he has them.
- Taking the leap is not some irrational act that is driven by the passions
- When you understand the asymmetrical nature of manageable concerns vs. unimaginable benefits, taking the leap is no longer an emotional jump, but a logical next step toward the life you want to lead.

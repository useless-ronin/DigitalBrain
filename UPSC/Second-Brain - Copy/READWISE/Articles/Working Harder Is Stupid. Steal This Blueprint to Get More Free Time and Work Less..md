## Highlights
- “No more working hard. It solves nothing. Time for you to get a new job.”
- Working harder gets you nowhere. If you can relate, try these things instead.
- Working harder is a bear trap. It’s one I’ve stepped on plenty of times.
- Quit fake workWorking harder is a bear
- A lot of what looks like working harder is simply fake work. Work that looks like work but isn’t. Fake work helps hide the real problems that haven’t got solved.
- If the work task isn’t on the list of your priorities, it’s bullsh*t work you’re using as an excuse to avoid real work.
- Ask the critics to shoot you down
- When I want a critic to help me solve a problem, I say “feel free to be brutal with your feedback.”
- Let critics help explain why you work so hard. Use the feedback to change.
- Automate everything like you’re Jeff Bezos
- If it’s a task done on a computer then Zapier will save your life from hard work
- Zapier can automate almost any task between multiple layers of software using the simple framework of “If This Then That.”
- Jeff Bezos made Amazon the king of automation. You can apply the same principle. Automate as much as possible
- Obliterate distractions
- Distractions make us dumb. We can’t resist the temptation.
- I don’t trust myself not to be distracted. The best way is to:Turn off all notifications on tablets, laptops, phones, computers.Put your phone in another room while you work.Set a list of priorities in the morning. Stay away from distractions until they’re done. Then reward yourself with a Zuckerberg app distraction.
- Pull out the big guns
- Ask others for help
- It’s easy to put on big boy pants and say “I’ve got this.” But getting work done isn’t about achieving hero status.
- Teamwork is better than one person working stupidly hard. Plus working together applies multiple brains to the one problem — the mental load is easier to remove that way.
- Put a plan in place
- Without a plan you’ll work hard.
- Spend time at the start of the week planning what needs to get done. Set some simple goals. Every night before bed loosely plan the next day.
- Write down the starter tasks that will create momentum. And debrief at the end of the week to see what went wrong, so you don’t slowly head down the path of insanity to overworking.
- Take care of your meat suit
- If your body is screwed your work is screwed. And once that happens the quality of work will go down and you’ll have to work harder to maintain it.
- Exercise daily. Whatever works for you — just move.Get sunshine. No sun equals too much time indoors.Give your mind a workout with books. A chapter a day keeps a burnt out mind away.Consume the good stuff. No need for a lecture. You know — fruit, whole grains, vegetables, water.
- Working harder isn’t the answer. It’s a cover-up for the real problem.The human body wasn’t designed to work hard, stare at a screen for 16 hours, and sit in a chair all day.Answers to hard problems come to you when you have more free time and work less. Now you’ve got a basic blueprint to stay away from overworking.

## Highlights
- Making Notes is for Making Connections
- There’s no point making a note if it’s to stay an untethered piece of flotsam.
- You’re in the note-making game to improve your life, right? And improving your life will undoubtedly help you to improve the lives of others. That’s why you need connections between your notes, and it’s why you need a system to help you find those connections.
- It’s the one at the intersection of your needs and your values
- Asking which Notes app is best is like asking —what the best Marvel movie isif you should get an Android or an iPhonewhether you should go see an osteopath or a physiotherapist to help you move betterif you should be wearing a Stetson, a Fedora, or an Akubra as your everyday hat
- You can have valid and even compelling reasons for your choice, but in the end it comes down to what you value most mixed in equal measure with your needs, plus a liberal sprinkling of personal taste.
- Plenty of people still love Evernote, even after all this time and even with the rising cost of access. Notion and Craft are also popular choices, and Napkin is making some very interesting waves. Oh, and Drafts! I can’t forget Drafts. That’s one subscription I always pay with a smile on my face.

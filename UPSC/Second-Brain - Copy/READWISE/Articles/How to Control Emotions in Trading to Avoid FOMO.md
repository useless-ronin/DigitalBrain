- Mock trading is a great tool for novice traders to sharpen their skills without any risks.
- Emotions can clutter a trader’s mind when not knowing how to manage them. Especially with the high volatility in the cryptocurrency markets that often leads to fear of missing out (FOMO) and panic selling.

- it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the 14 stages of the psychology of a market cycle to be aware of how your emotions may be controlling your trades.
- Disbelief - After a prolonged downward trend, or bear market, traders tend to disregard the first rallies into a bull market because they believe the uptrend will fail to gain strength
- Hope - After a significant price recovery from the lows, traders start to think that it is possible for the uptrend to hold.
- Optimism - Traders become more confident about the uptrend’s strength as prices start trending higher.
- Belief - Traders have faith that the uptrend will hold and start entering the market with the expectation that prices will continue to surge
- Thrill - As profits start to pile up, the market sentiment turns bullish and traders are more vocal about the positions that they are entering.
- Euphoria - After a parabolic price increase, FOMO starts kicking in among traders who feel that the uptrend will continue, there is more money to be made, and nothing can go wrong.
- Complacency - Traders often mistake the first pullback after a parabolic price increase for a brief retracement to collect liquidity before new all-time highs.
- Anxiety - As prices continue to drop without a major recovery, traders become concerned and worried about the state of the uptrend
- Denial - Traders become long-term HODLers because they believe prices will eventually the market will reverse and they will be able to recover their profits.
- Panic - As prices continue to free fall, traders start to panic sell their holding to cut losses short and keep some capital to buy at the bottom.
- Capitulation - Nothing seems to stop prices from continuing to decline, which generates further panic among traders and even the long-term HODLers sell.
- Anger - Traders cannot believe that they never realized profits when the market was trending up, and they become angry at themselves because of the losses that they have incurred.
- Depression - All hope is lost, and traders feel foolish for not exiting the market at the right time and believing that prices were going to continue to increase.
- Avoiding FOMO and Panic Selling
- Developing and sticking to a trading plan that works for you is the best method, plain and simple. A trading plan should outline the kind of conditions that make a setup tradeable as well as your objectives and the risk that you are willing to take on each trade.
- Keeping a trading journal to record everything you do as a trader, including strategy development, risk management, feelings, and every step of the process can also be a very effective tool to avoid FOMO and panic selling.
- Successful traders usually have a clear understanding of the losses or the profits they will incur before entering a trade
- Many of the emotions that come up when trading are predictable, but if you fail to recognize when you are experiencing them, it is harder to manage them.
- Responsible trading is about having complete control over your trades and taking responsibility for your actions. Trading responsibly calls for not spending beyond your means and not risking money that you cannot afford to lose.
- you cannot let social media take over your trades, especially crypto Twitter. Whether through confirmation bias or shared panic, social media can influence your emotions drastically.

- “How do you stand out among billions of people publishing content via an algorithmic newsfeed?”
- If you don’t have an answer to the attention hunger games, your ideas, which you’ve spent years researching, are dead on arrival.
- Viral Content Vs. Content That’s “Dead On Arrival”: Most People Get It Wrong
- people see your value hook in the context of a feed of 10+ other value hooks.
- The value hook is the elevator pitch of online content.
- before readers even get to your content, you must win them over in the newsfeed
- Readers aren’t in a bookstore looking for a book. Rather, they’re in a line waiting to check out their groceries, and they’re bored.
- you must create an itch so strong that the reader MUST scratch it.
- The Psychology Of Value Hooks Revealed
- If you’re not getting the traffic you want, it’s probably because of your value hook.
- what are they sharing? The value hook alone.
- The #1 Mistake Most Writers And Thought Leaders Make (No Matter What Industry)
- how to master the skill of creating a value hook, you’re already ahead of most people
- Most creators spend hours creating the content and minutes creating the value hook… even though the value hook is critical and what readers see first.
- The deeper problem is that people under-estimate the sheer amount of competition and over-estimate how good their idea is relative to others (like I did when I first started writing).
- Creating the idea first is putting the cart before the horse
- “I don’t even think about ideas anymore. I just think about titles.” —RL Stine
- : If content is the king, the value hook is the queen.
- Why Mastering Value Hooks Is The Most Important Skill On The Internet (No Matter What Industry Or Niche)
- Benefit #1: Value hooks can be used as memes throughout the article to increase virality
- Rather than just viewing subheaders as ways to improve readability, I started to think of them as opportunities for value hooks.
- combining quotes and visuals can create a synergistic effect where 1+1 = 10.
- any quote can have multiple visuals. And any visual can have multiple quotes.
- coining your own word or phrase (what I call a trademark idea)
- You create a trademark idea by identifying areas where a word should exist but doesn’t yet.
- value hooks give up in nuance and depth, they make up for in virality, speed of comprehension and creation, and stickiness
- Benefit #2: There is no other skill that has as much leverage
- the best quotes or images can last for thousands of years. They can literally turn into art people hang on their walls or use as wallpaper for their desktop.
- Old: “A picture is worth a thousand words” New: “A value hook is worth a thousand books.”
- Master value hooks.
- The value hook is the Archimedes lever of creating content in an online environment. It is where the smallest amount of effort can pack as much punch as an entire article.
- Hooks can stand alone and be commented on, shared, and liked on various social media platforms. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram are specifically designed for them.
- Benefit #3: Your chances of success on every platform and medium increase
- many would-be thought leaders never get started because of overwhelm. I call this the thought leadership maze of hell.
- No matter what path you take, improving your value hooks will help you be more successful. No matter what platform. No matter what strategy.
- Benefit #4: There is very little competition so it’s easier to stand out
- Almost no thought leaders think of value hooks as a skill, let alone study, practice, and test them.
- Benefit #5: Value hooks are the easiest thought leadership skill to master
- Creating value hooks is the 80/20 micro-skill, and it also happens to be the easiest part of thought leadership to apply deliberate practice to because…
- There are fewer skills required to master value hooks than creating blockbuster content.
- It is 10x cheaper and faster to test value hooks than content
- In 5 hours, you can easily double your ability to create value hooks. It could take dozens or even hundreds of hours to improve to the same amount as a writer.
- Benefit #6: Just one great value hook can be worth $1 million
- value hooks set the frame. And whoever sets the frame, wins the game.
- I’ve influenced you on a fundamental level without you even realizing it.
- He has set the frame. And that frame influences what people write about. And coincidentally (or maybe not), just 10 hours before Musk tweeted this…
- you’re only one good hook away from going to the next level in your business, scaling your message to millions of people, and generating millions in revenue over time.
- Benefit #7: A great hook can 10x your reach via repurposing
- when I have a hit article, I typically syndicate it across 5–10 platforms. Those platforms then promote it heavily because it performs so well.
- Once you have a hook, you can also re-use it over and over.
- Benefit #8: Value hooks are the linchpin of the viral loop
- the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
- First, social media sites show you love.
- you log into social media, you don’t see all the posts of everyone you follow. You only see a tiny fraction of them… the ones the algorithm has selected. Given that social media sites are in the business of selling ads, they feature content that people engage with and bury non-engaging content.
- Second, virality compounds the value of your value hook.
- After a reader shares your article, the first thing their friends see is your value hook. Then the first thing your friends’ friends see is your value hook. Your value hook gets reused over and over.
- Third, online writers are constantly looking for things to write about.
- If you have an amazing value hook, they will use the hook to create their own content
- Fourth, aggregators are constantly looking for content to curate
- First, commit to mastering value hooks.
- Second, commit to creating blockbuster content
- The magic happens when you combine blockbuster content and value hooks.
- Having an incredible value hook with mediocre content will just train people to ignore you.

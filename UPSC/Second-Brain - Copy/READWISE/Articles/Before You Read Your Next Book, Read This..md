# Highlights 
Then what makes you think that just reading a book is going to help you in any way?  ^278320040

was like, I was trying to make lemonade by just looking at the lemons  ^278320041

Books cost money and time and it’s better to read them the right way or not do it at all. By books, I mean only non-fiction  ^278320042

Your brain will probably not be able to process 100 pages at once let alone retain them.  ^278320043

You’ll be able to focus on other important things in life. Reading books alone does not guarantee success. You have to plan your goals, strategize, execute and achieve!  ^278320044

---

Most importantly, you will always enjoy your reading sessions!  ^278320045

don’t recommend dividing books based on chapters and topics because sometimes one chapter can be way lengthier/shorter than the other.  ^278320046

---

you don’t have to take notes immediately after finishing your reading session  ^278320047

Before you begin your next reading session, make sure you go through the previous day’s notes.  ^278320048

Publicity is more important than marketing for building a great brand. Publicity through press conferences, newspaper articles, TV interviews, magazine articles, etc. News Media wants to talk about What’s New, What’s Hot, What’s First, not What’s better. All the greatest companies ever were first created in the pages of The Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Forbes, Fortune, etc by Publicity, not by Advertising. Publicity is what gives birth to a brand.  ^278320049

Publicity through press conferences, newspaper articles, TV interviews, magazine articles, etc. is what gives birth to a brand.This way you will end up with a summary that you can read anytime you want. Moreover, the highlighted text will reduce the summary even more.  ^278320050

---

My book summaries are often 10–15-minute reads while the highlighted texts are usually 2–3 minute reads. Too short does not work.  ^278320051

Revisiting old notes is always fun!  ^278320052

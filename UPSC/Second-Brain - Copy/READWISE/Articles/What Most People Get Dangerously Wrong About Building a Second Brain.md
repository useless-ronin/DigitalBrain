## Highlights
- Note-taking systems can improve your life. A well-organized knowledge base can give you clarity of mind and save you time
- yet, Tiago is also dangerously wrong.
- Your short-term memory can only store about four to seven items for a very short time (15–30 seconds). It’s what helps you remember a phone number until you get distracted.
- Your long-term memory capacity is vast.
- if you manage to transfer information from your short-term to your long-term memory, you can store as much as you want for as long as you want.
- How to Store Things in Your Long-Term Memory
- When you look something up (e.g. in your second brain on Evernote), you use up the limited space and not much capacity is left to process the new information or combine it with existing things, so you have new ideas.
- Remember, you can only hold four to seven items in your short-term memory.
- If you don’t memorise facts to encode them into your long-term memory, you’ll never have the same processing fluency and thought quality as someone who has. It’s as if you’re trying to win a race walking barefoot while the other person sits on an e-bike.
- The benefit of remembering information is not in the knowledge itself but in the way you can deploy it. You build a mental structure that helps you develop new thoughts and knowledge through memorisation.
- What to Do Instead
- transferring information into your long-term memory works best when you reproduce the same piece of information from your mind over increasing time intervals.
- stop thinking of these tools as your second brain.
- The assumption that you don’t need to remember anything yourself will prevent you from thinking critically and having great ideas.

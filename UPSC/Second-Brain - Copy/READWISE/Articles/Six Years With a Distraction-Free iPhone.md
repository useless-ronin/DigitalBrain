## Highlights
- had sort of materialized in my hand. All day, I’d been looking forward to spending time with my kids, and now that it was finally happening, I wasn’t really there at all.
- But I needed a justification, so I convinced myself that I needed it for work. A
- They were shiny, they were free, and they helped me “get my money’s worth” out of my phone. Every app created new responsibilities
- More inboxes to check and more feeds to read.
- I wanted the iPhone to make my life better. I wanted a futuristic tool and I wanted to be in control of it.
- I deleted Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. I deleted YouTube, ESPN, and all my games. Then I went into the settings and removed Safari.
- I gritted my teeth and deleted Gmail. I even went into settings and deleted my Google account to disable Apple’s Mail app.
- Without my apps, I expected to feel anxiety and isolation.
- The first few days were strange. I’d unlock my phone, only to remember there was nothing to check. Before, getting up-to-date on my apps provided a small sense of accomplishment. Unlock the phone, tap, boom! It was like a sugar rush. Now, the candy was gone
- It was weird, but it was also weirdly… peaceful. My attention span lengthened. Time slowed down, in a good way. My head was free. Untethered.
- My phone still has fantastic maps and a kick-ass camera. It even has a flashlight!
- A distraction-free iPhone is a futuristic tool that I control. It’s what I really wanted all along.
- Without infinite friends, I paid better attention to moments with my wife and kids. This, for me, was and is the most important reason to redesign my relationship with my phone. It’s also very personal and specific to me, so I’m not going to linger on it.
- Distraction-Free Is a Competitive Advantage
- When I stopped instantly reacting to everyone else’s priorities, I got better at making time for the projects I believed were most important—even if they weren’t urgent or nobody was asking for them
- Doing big projects takes many sessions of focused work, added up over time. It’s like building a pyramid, and every work session is like cutting a block of stone and stacking it on the foundation.
- Bizarro Jake can’t put his own priorities first. But if I can focus, I can make progress on blog posts, illustrations, slide decks, and book chapters — projects that matter to me, even if nobody is asking for them
- . I didn’t suddenly acquire willpower or self-control. I’m far from perfect. But without those apps in my pocket, I have a competitive advantage over my prior self.
- Hold on. Apple, Google, and Facebook are all rolling out tools to help us control our screen time. Is the problem already fixed?
- He’ll still hear the Ring calling. He’ll keep shattering the blocks of his pyramid. Turning down the firehose a few percent does not create freedom.
- If your phone gets in the way of whoever and whatever is important to you, don’t accept the compromise. Take matters into your own hands and design the phone you want.
- go all the way and delete every distracting app,
- 1. Decide WHY you want more attention
- 2. Set expectations
- 3. Delete social media apps.
- 4. Delete news apps.
- 5. Delete streaming video apps and games
- 6. Remove web browsers
- 7. Delete email and other “productivity” messaging apps.
- Give It Two Hours and See How You Feel
- if all of this sounds too intense, start small and just delete the one or two apps that bother you the most, and see how long you can go.
- being the boss of my attention. Over the last six years, I’ve been able to pay attention to more moments with my wife and kids. More often, I feel like I’m being the dad I want to be.
- It’s a distracting world out there, and every moment is a battle to focus on what matters. Still, without infinity in my pocket, the odds are in my favor.
- You may have more self-control than I do, but if you ever feel bossed around by your phone, don’t just accept a compromise from the settings panel.

## Highlights
- Wasting time is something we are all guilty of doing. There isn’t one person reading this that hasn’t spent several hours doing something unproductive or unnecessary.
- Believe it or not, the best of the best still spend a lot of time doing something they shouldn’t be doing. The difference is these people have committed themselves to accomplish what they had planned for the day before they slack off and relax.
- Breaks are an important feature in remaining focused and not overworking.
- Successful individuals have trained their mind to only focus on what’s important and essential for the day to be a victory.
- 1 — Social Media
- 2 — Lack of a plan
- 3 — Lousiness
- 6 — No Side Hustle or “Beneficial Hobby”
- 7 — Discouragement
- It’s never too late to change. Tomorrow could be the day you decide that you’re done spending your time getting nowhere, and you’re ready to spend your time making progress. Every day you can do something to become closer to achieving your goals.
- If you’re not moving forward, you’re going backward.
- In my life, I’ve had a radical change. I almost did sorta wake up one day and say I’m tired of just living. I’m going to work towards what I want in life and make sure every day I complete important tasks and improve at least one skill. It’s been one of the biggest changes in my life.
- I’m serious when I say this — I can’t watch more than one youtube video a day that’s not informal and educational, without feeling like I am wasting time
- I even click a second video that is just for entertainment purposes, my mind will repeat and repeat “this is wasting time”
- I hold myself accountable for spending the least amount of time doing unproductive and unimportant activities.
- I can’t do those things anymore. I’ve quit smoking, video games, and many other things because sacrifice is beyond important to winning.
- I’m going to do what I must do now, so I can do what I want to do later.
- I want it all. I know I won’t get that without spending every day improving, practicing, training, and working on getting better. Remember these 7 things as they are key factors keeping you from getting to where you want to be in life.

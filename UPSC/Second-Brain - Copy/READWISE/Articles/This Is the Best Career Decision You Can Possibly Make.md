## Highlights
- There has never been anyone like us…and there never will be again. We have been given a complete and total monopoly over the business of being us
- Yet what do we do with this rarest of rarities? We give it up! We choose not to be ourselves
- Peter Thiel has said before that the only kind of business worth making is one where you can have a monopoly
- The profits, he said, are in owning an entire market.
- BE YOU. Be the only one of you in the whole world. Be the red. That’s where the fun is (without having to fake it).
- That’s where the money is (you can name your price). That’s where the value is (you can’t be replaced).
- The vast majority of them are not new, or even particularly famous. But they are books we have loved over the years.
- If people want to discover new books and have a unique experience, they come to us. There are a lot of bookstores in the world, but there are nonelike ours.
- “competition is for losers,” Epictetus quipped that, “You can always win if you only enter competitions where winning is up to you.”
- When you’re the fortieth Indian restaurant in town, your chances of success are dependent on so many things that are outside your influence: how good the other restaurants are, who gets the best location, whether the critic at the local paper likes your biryani.
- It’s far better then, if you were to launch a restaurant, to come up with something totally new, or to create a new kind of dining experience for which you can have a monopoly
- Where the contest is not with other people, but with being the best version of yourself. I
- In this way, you’re set up, if not guaranteed, to be a double winner
- Too many people pointlessly enter contests where the outcome is dependent on forces outside their control
- They think it’s safer to be like everyone else…when in fact, what they’re really doing is hiding themselves in the chorus, protecting themselves from judgment
- They’re less likely to be singled out and laughed at, sure, but they’re guaranteeing that they’ll never really be noticed or appreciated
- Staying with that forever doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be the biggest or most popular thing in the world. But it does mean you’ll have a monopoly. And that you’ll always be a winner.

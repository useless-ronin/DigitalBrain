# Highlights 
Overall, people work less today than they did 100 years ago. And there is no clear evidence that the pace of life has accelerated.  ^278319432

---

institutions that used to regulate our time have all but vanished.  ^278319433

---

The same goes for dinner: you had to be at the dinner table on time, or else there would be consequences. Today, family dinners have all but disappeared.  ^278319434

---

While you may sometimes worry about when’s the best time to do your laundry, a few decades ago the answer was clear: Monday was laundry day.  ^278319435

---

Free to manage our own time  ^278319436

---

people’s time used to be regulated by society, the government, religion, family and many other institutions.  ^278319437

---

Today, we have more freedom than ever to manage our time in ways that best suit us.  ^278319438

---

What a time to be alive!  ^278319439

---

Technology gives us the tools to manage our time in ways that best suit our lives.  ^278319440

---

But freedom also means responsibility: we’re now responsible for managing our own time instead of following rules set by institutions like family or religion that tell us how to spend our days.  ^278319441

---

Time management was easier decades ago: people’s time was, in a very real sense, managed for them by outside forces.  ^278319442

---

They didn’t have to constantly consider what they should do next, or how to prioritize their tasks. Today, these decisions rest squarely on our shoulders.  ^278319443

---

Still a great time to be alive  ^278319444

---

With all this freedom, you get the chance to do things your way and live your life exactly as you see fit, at least to a greater extent than your grandparents, who didn’t have the time freedom we take for granted.  ^278319445

---

while time management may be harder, your opportunities are greater than ever.  ^278319446

---

It’s not efficiency, productivity or getting things done. It’s the ability to make our schedule a reflection of our values, beliefs and philosophy  ^278319447

---

while time management may be more challenging than before, it’s also more rewarding. What we lose in ease and routine, we make up for with the ability to create our lives on our own terms  ^278319448

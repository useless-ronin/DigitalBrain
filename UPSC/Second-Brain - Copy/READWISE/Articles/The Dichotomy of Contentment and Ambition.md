## Highlights
- Can you be ambitious and yet feel fulfilled?
  I have wrestled with this question for two decades
- Should I be content, which leads to lethargy, or should I be ambitious, which seems to lead to pride and disappointment? Is this a paradox to explore or a dissonance to solve?
- The answer was always right there in front of me, but I had to pursue persistently to show that I was desperate for the answer.
- There are three aspects to life in this context: being, doing, and having.
- Being - what you are; who you are; what characters you exhibit etc
  Doing - what you do for yourself, family, and others.
  Having - what you accumulate in this life - not just tangible things like money, car, and house but also intangible things like fame, network.
- I should be ambitious in being and becoming a better person; I should be ambitious in doing good for others and myself; I should be ambitious in making this world a better place; I should be ambitious in fulfilling my purpose in this life. Itâ€™s no humility to live a lesser life than the one you are capable of living. At the same time, I should be content with what I have achieved, acquired, and accumulated.
- this is yin and yang. You need to have this duality at the same time.

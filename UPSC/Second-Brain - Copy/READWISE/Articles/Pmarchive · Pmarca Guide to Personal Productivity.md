## Highlights
- Productivity porn (or, for those really in the know, “productivity pr0n") consists of techniques, tactics, and tricks for maximizing personal productivity—or, as they say, “getting things done”.
- The techniques that follow work together as an integrated set for me, but they probably won’t for you. Maybe you’ll get one or two ideas—probably out of the ideas I stole from other people. If so, I have succeeded.
- don’t keep a schedule
- By not keeping a schedule, I mean: refuse to commit to meetings, appointments, or activities at any set time in any future day
- As a result, you can always work on whatever is most important or most interesting, at any time
- Want to spend all day writing a research report? Do it!
  Want to spend all day coding? Do it!
- Want to spend all day at the cafe down the street reading a book on personal productivity? Do it!
- When someone emails or calls to say, “Let’s meet on Tuesday at 3”, the appropriate response is: “I’m not keeping a schedule for 2007, so I can’t commit to that, but give me a call on Tuesday at 2:45 and if I’m available, I’ll meet with you.”
- Or, if it’s important, say, “You know what, let’s meet right now.”
- If you have a structured job, a structured job environment, or you’re a CEO, it will be hard to pull off.
- it’s really liberating, and will lead to far higher productivity than almost any other tactic you can try.
- he doesn’t schedule appointments in advance.
- As a result, for 20 years he has been free to work on whatever is most important in his life at any time.
- This also gives you the best odds of maximizing flow, which is a whole ’nother topic but highly related.
- I get so much more time to focus on the things that really matte
- Keep three and only three lists: a Todo List, a Watch List, and a Later List.
- The more into lists you are, the more important this is.
- Into the Watch List goes all the stuff going on in your life that you have to follow up on, wait for someone else to get back to you on, remind yourself of in the future, or otherwise remember
- Into the Todo List goes all the stuff you “must” do—commitments, obligations, things that have to be done. A single list, possibly subcategorized by timeframe (today, this week, next week, next month).
- Into the Later List goes everything else—everything you might want to do or will do when you have time or wish you could do.
- If it doesn’t go on one of those three lists, it goes away.
- Each night before you go to bed, prepare a 3x5 index card with a short list of 3 to 5 things that you will do the next day.
- I sit down at my desk before I go to sleep, pull up my Todo List (which I keep in Microsoft Word’s outline mode, due to long habit), and pick out the 3 to 5 things I am going to get done tomorrow. I write those things on a fresh 3x5 card, lay the card out with my card keys, and go to bed. Then, the next day, I try like hell to get just those things done. If I do, it was a successful day.
- People who have tried lots of productivity porn techniques will tell you that this is one of the most successful techniques they have ever tried.
- Once you get into the habit, you start to realize how many days you used to have when you wouldn’t get 3 to 5 important/significant/meaningful things done during a day.
- use the back of the 3x5 card as your Anti-Todo List.
- Each time you do something, you get to write it down and you get that little rush of endorphins that the mouse gets every time he presses the button in his cage and gets a food pellet.
- Then tear it up and throw it away.
  Another day well spent, and productive.
- in order to do this, you have to carry a pen with you everywhere you go.
- Structured Procrastination.
  This is a great one.
- The gist of Structured Procrastination is that you should never fight the tendency to procrastinate—instead, you should use it to your advantage in order to get other things done.
- Generally in the course of a day, there is something you have to do that you are not doing because you are procrastinating.
- While you’re procrastinating, just do lots of other stuff instead.
- The best way to to make sure that you are never asked to do something again is to royally screw it up the first time you are asked to do it.
- The other key two-word tactic: Strategic Incompetence
- just say you know you will royally screw it up—maintain a strong voice and a clear gaze, and you’ll probably get off the hook.
- Do email exactly twice a day
- once first thing in the morning, and once at the end of the workday.
- keep your email client shut and your email notifications turned off
- Anyone who needs to reach you so urgently that it can’t wait until later in the day or tomorrow morning can call you, or send a runner, or send up smoke signals, or something else
- Or, more likely, find someone else who can do whatever it is that needs doing.
- Only doing email twice a day will make you far more productive for the rest of the day.
- The pleasure chemical hits your neocortex and you go “ahhh" inside and feel like you’ve done something.
- So you sit and work with your mail client open and you interrupt your work every time an email comes in and you answer it and you send another email and you feel great in the moment.
- But what you’re really doing is fracturing your time, interrupting your flow, and killing your ability to focus on anything long enough to get real high-quality work done.
- always finish each of your two daily email sessions with a completely empty inbox.
- either answer or file every single message until you get to that empty inbox state of grace.
- emails relating to topics that are current working projects or pressing issues go into temporary subfolders of a folder called Action.
- only keep three standing email folders: Pending, Review, and Vault.
- Don’t answer the phone.
- Let it go to voicemail, and then every few hours, screen your voicemails and batch the return calls.
- Cell phones and family plans are so cheap these days that I think the best thing to do is have two cell phones with different numbers—one for key family members, your closest friends, and your boss and a few coworkers, and the other for everyone else.
- Answer the first one when it rings, but never answer the second one.
- Hide in an IPod.
- It’s great—a lot of the time, people will walk up to you, start to say something, notice the headphones, apologize (using exaggerated mouth motions), and walk away.
- you don’t actually have to be listening to anything.
  Hell, you don’t even have to have the headphones plugged into anything.
- matter what time you get up, start the day with a real, sit-down breakfast
- Only agree to new commitments when both your head and your heart say yes.
- Do something you love.
- If you’re not doing something you love with the majority of your time, and you have any personal freedom and flexibility whatsoever, it’s time for a change
- And this doesn’t mean something that you love doing in theory—but rather, the core thing you love doing in practice.

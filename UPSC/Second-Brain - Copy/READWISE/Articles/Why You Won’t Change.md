## Highlights
- A businessman does not see focused work as a burden every morning. They ARE a person who gets work done every morning.
- we have the power to recondition, reprogram, or rewire our brain — but our harmonic oscillator of a mind won’t let us off that easy.
- If you receive negative feedback, you won’t do that again.
  If you receive positive feedback, you will do that again.
- you attempt to change your identity by making one small change, you displace equilibrium (or tip over a pot of glue) and potentially set fire to a portion of the city that has been built in your mind over years of construction (conditioning).
- Changing your beliefs, identity, and life is not as simple as it sounds.
- Layers Of Identity
- The human psyche is wired for survival. When your beliefs, identity, or life is threatened — the brain signals the body, your focus starts to narrow, and you give a bit too much attention to the thoughts flooding your mind.
- A healthy person does not see eating healthy as a chore. They ARE a person that eats healthy.
- malleable nature of our mind can be very dangerous (when unconscious) or very beneficial (when conscious).
- If you want to change your life, you must change your identity.
- Humans are the only beings that equate the death of a belief to physical death.
- Like training a dog. They don’t understand words, but they can associate tones and patterns with certain meanings — positive and negative.
- live in a completely different world than our ancestors. We are rarely threatened on a physical level. Most of us have shelter, access to food, and the ability to make a living.
- Our mind is a network of complex systems that have been conditioned over time through positive and negative feedback.
- The action, belief, or thought pattern become habitual. They happen on autopilot.
- When you feel on top of the world, nothing can stop you.
  When you fall to the bottom of the ocean, anything can stop you.
- You may take it as negative feedback — conditioning a faulty systematic thought pattern — and avoid anything that threatens the identity that isn’t conducive to a high quality of life.
- As you reverse engineer your vision into 10-year, 1-year, and monthly goals — you start to gain clarity on what you need to do in order to actualize that vision.
- Stay conscious and aware through silent observation (that can apply to your mental, physical, financial, and spiritual projects).
- When you try reconstruct a piece of your city, it may threaten the entire foundation. When you are at the bottom of the wave, you can’t see anything. You may lose hope for reaching the shore. You may tip over your kayak a few times.
- Actively Construct Your Life
- If you believe you are having fun on a roller coaster of waves, you will have fun.
- Everybody I have met that hit rock bottom was from an unfortunate hand they were dealt with by life itself.
- When you reconstruct your city piece by piece, you build what would be New Seattle (without having to burn down half the city).
- 1) Hit rock bottom.
- The easiest way to do this is by treating every facet of your life as a project.
- How To Reinvent Yourself
- 2) Stack small wins.
- How do you actively construct your life?
  Through consciousness, creativity, and intention.
- Document a replicable process that can help other people and bring you more feedback.
  Rinse and repeat.
  It took 18+ years to condition you to the point you are now.
  Don’t expect much progress overnight.
- By getting crystal clear on your vision and anti-vision.
- If you believe you are in the middle of a storm, you will be.
- All of the buildings, foundations, streets, and other networks are all interconnected. Layers upon layers that rely on each other for proper function.
- When you outline a vision for your future, it will shine the light of awareness on your blindspots.
- you must play an active role in constructing your life. This requires personal responsibility, massive self-belief, and the realization that nobody is coming to save you.
- You dig deep into the layers of your identity and find just the right piece to remove in order to launch in the opposite direction
- Removing a specific part may cause temporary damage to how the systems function.
- Life is chaotic. Ordering consciousness through vision and goal setting is how we gain a sense of certainty and control over our life.
- Self-educate to expand awareness and uncover new paths.
- What is the smallest mental, physical, emotional, or financial step you can take?

## Highlights
- It was a long journey that started with a class assignment to apply behavior change in an actual experiment on a person or animal
- The American Psychological Association lists exercise and moving toward one’s goals as 2 of 10 ways to build resilience
- Endurance exercises help you maintain proper posture, and the stronger muscles that result from them make it easier for you to perform everyday tasks like lifting objects, climbing stairs, and standing, reducing risks of injury.
- Competence: We need to experience mastery; our ability to control outcomes.
- Autonomy: We need to have a sense of control in our lives and be “us”—to live in a way that is congruent with our sense of self.
- Relatedness: We need to feel a sense of connectedness to other people.
- “If/then” scenarios for competence
- Plan: The logistics of completing so many push-ups isn’t always easy. Sometimes you’ll find yourself doing sets in odd places (like the back or front of a classroom, a bathroom floor, or a hallway). Decide on the time of day and place that works best for you, but also have backups.
- Persist: You have to pace yourself. Working to exhaustion isn’t the objective
- Think, “This is a marathon, not a sprint.”
- Prosper: Each daily accomplishment fed the next. If I could do 500 push-ups one day, I certainly could do 525 the next. What was 25 more? This kind of thinking creates a positive feedback loop.

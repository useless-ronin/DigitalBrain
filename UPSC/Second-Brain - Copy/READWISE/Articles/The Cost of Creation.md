## Highlights
- There is no better time to be a creator than now, they say.
- Never before has it been so simple to get paid for doing what you love, they say.
- If you have a phone, you have access to the entire world, they say.But the truth?There is a cost of creation and that cost is far too high for the multitude to pay.
- And what is this cost?
- It is the agreement with yourself to constantly create, to dedicate yourself to becoming a manufacturer of your mind. Yet this factory of facts that you have setup within your head does not have a union. It does not have off hours or holidays. It does not have benefits. It has only you, the foreman, the CEO, the president, the creator.
- There is no magic bullet for this. You have to commit yourself to the creative cause and drive output if you want to be successful. This usually means reading, researching, writing, rewriting, and pressing forward, even when you lack the motivation to do so.
- Because you will lack the motivation. You will lack the patience and discipline and energy that true creation requires. You will find the distractions both welcoming and ample. Soon you will find that the time you set aside to create has been wasted, lost to the social media feeds, YouTube videos, drama, and more.A true creator knows this but they push through. They avoid the distractions. They understand that the blank page isn’t daunting, but a welcome challenge.After all, it is only the blank page that holds infinite potential and infinite rewards.
- “If you want to write, if you want to create, you must be the most sublime fool that God ever turned out and sent rambling. You must write every single day of your life…Just write every day of your life. Read intensely. Then see what happens. Most of my friends who are put on that diet have very pleasant careers.” -Ray Bradbury

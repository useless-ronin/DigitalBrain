## Highlights
- You can’t buy happiness. You can buy pleasure though.
- A lot of people will say “oh money isn’t happiness but money can buy you a boat, and a boat will make you happy”.
- When people ask why rich people aren’t as happy, I just think it’s because they’ve upped the bar so far that only the best things satisfy them.
- Now if I go to the best restaurant in the world, I might be at a 6 or 7. I’m just satisfied. I got 3 chefs, I eat the best food all the time. That doesn’t make me happy anmore
- If somebody bought me a Lamborghini, I’d be “whatever”. I’ve had them, I don’t care.
- But if you give it to a guy off the street, he’d be at a 10.
- There are a lot of people who are trying to get rich because they think once they’ll be rich, they’ll be happy. They think that that’s going to give them this thing that they’ve always been missing. So they’ve been working hard, busting their ass, and they look at all these other people.
- But once you’re that guy, that doesn’t mean anything anymore
- So for a lot of people, there’s this emptiness. There’s nothing left to chase. There’s nothing else to do. And your life is just about possessions and upping the ante
- Trying to find something to fill that void because you’ve sort of set your life up to chase these material goals, instead of to try to find out what actually does make you happy.
- Yeah, you have to have goals. You gotta be climbing the mountain. Because at the end of the day, climbing the mountain is far more satisfying than being at the top of the mountain.
- it’s counter intuitive. My dad told me “it’s better to give than receive”.
- you have to buy all that shit, okay I got it all, it made me happy. But it’s temporary.
- That’s where I differentiate the happiness and the pleasure. You can buy the pleasure, but the pleasure is so much shorter lived.
- Buddhist guy was saying that sex and all these material possessions, they possess you. And to be completely free, you have to be abstinent. And free of material possessions. And I said “why?”. What if you achieve a level of success where you don’t worry about those things anymore. And they don’t contain you. They don’t hold you. You’re not a prisoner of them. Because you’re really not worried about them. If all you had was this one thing and that one thing was taken from you that would be devastating. And that’s what this is based on. But what if you had unlimited resources? If you were Richard Branson or someone like you? It’s not an issue. Then those material possessions no longer posses you. This guy didn’t wanna look at it that way. He didn’t wanna think that was ever an option. I said you don’t think it’s an option because you don’t think it’s possible for you to ever achieve that level of material possession.
- And that’s kind of a thing, I feel you have to get to that place to understand it.
- But in some ways that’s a blessing because they’re going to have a lifetime of being able to buy that pleasure too because of that. Because if you start on this lower run, then all those little purchases, you’re enjoying them. Their baseline is just lower
- Exactly. And when that wears off, they’re going to get a new reel. And then a new depth finder. It’s the little stuff, if that makes them happy. Then that’s okay.
- They get a new fishing rod, they’re pumped.

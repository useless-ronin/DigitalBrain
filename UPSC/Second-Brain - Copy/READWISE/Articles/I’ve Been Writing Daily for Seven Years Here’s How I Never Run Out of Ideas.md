## Highlights
- Aspiring writers act as if I came out of the womb knowing how to write well.I worked my ass off for seven years.
- many writers will tell me they love this technique but they won’t use it — even some of the students in my blogging course.
- Write down ten ideas for blog post headlines every day.
- To this day, only two or three of the headline ideas are good. Only one in a handful of sessions are great.
- A few have become the seeds for legendary viral posts that built my career. But I never knew when the greatest ideas would come. I just worked at them every day
- I stole the idea technique from James Altucher. I steal stuff from people all the time. You’ve probably heard the concept of stealing like an artist. I stole that too.
- Most people try way too hard to be original. People who try to be original never get anything done.
- you’re not so smart and creative that you have an idea that no one else has thought of before.
- Of course, there are anomalies, but you’re probably not one of them. Sorry.
- Learn how to stand on the shoulders of giants, borrow from timeless wisdom, and draw from a variety of sources to come up with ideas of your own
- I’m always looking for a way to combine and remix source material into something that’s unique because of the way I combined and remixed it.
- Practice your craft while living said life, and you’ll realize everything is material
- it’s always important to keep a pen and paper handy. You never know when an idea will strike. Or where.
- You’ll take yourself seriously as an artist, an entrepreneur, a career ascender — anyone who needs ideas as currency — when you realize that every second of your life is a chance to observe and draw insight.
- “Nothing bad can happen to a writer. Everything is material.”
- the lows are usually more compelling because there are few things more authentic than feeling like crap.
- Consume AND Create
- sometimes being lazy makes you more creative.
- It’s a slippery slope for sure. But you can find great ideas in moments where you’re casually consuming instead of boldly creating.
- Go ahead and blow a whole day reading a novel. Visit a museum and wander around for a while. Spend 12 hours straight watching interesting YouTube videos and documentaries.
- writing suffers when I don’t consume enough.
- Again, it’s easy to fall into the trap of constant consumption without creating anything or generating legitimate ideas, which leads me to my next point.
- Stop being
- Stop being lazy.
- Come up with ideas every single day.Focus on your craft every single day.“Writer’s block is a phony, made up, b.s. excuse for not doing your work.” — Jerry Seinfield

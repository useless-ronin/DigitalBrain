## Highlights
- What you are going to say is probably not more urgent than what I decided to do right now.
- I hate being interrupted
- 2- Because my agenda and tasks are also on my phone
- 1- Because I’m busy
- If you have to tell me something really urgent, you can leave a message (preferably by SMS or email, btw), and you will probably call again later.
- why I love emails so much.
- it’s good business practice to follow-up by email (or any persistant type of communication) to recap decisions and actions points after a vocal discussion.
- 5- Because repeating yourself is costly
- 3- Because a call leaves no trace
- 4- Because your communication is worse
- Solution: Writing an email is an opportunity to think about the message you want to transmit.
- this immediateness increases the chance of the caller to thinking out loud, because he didn’t take the time to think before reaching out to the callee.
- follow-up by email, it’s more efficient (in most cases) to exchange directly by email.

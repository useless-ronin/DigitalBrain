## Highlights
- Time management, in itself, isn’t that bad of an idea. But it loses its charm (and utility) when coupled with the most addictive poison of our time: the hype!
- Time management isn’t the miracle cure to all your life problems
- You can work around your schedule and get yourself two minimum wedge jobs instead of one. But that wouldn’t be the best use of your time. Would it?
- It’s Not About How Much You Do at Any Given Time. It’s About What You Do With That Said Time
- Money is something you trade your life energy for. You sell your time for money. It doesn’t matter that Ned over there sells his time for a hundred dollars and you sell yours for twenty dollars an hour.”
- The actual value of the money you are making= {Your gross income -(Living cost + Taxes + Loans)} / Inflation
- The actual time you are trading in= Duty hours + Overtimes + Years of studying + Recovery time from the burnout
- “Rich or poor, time is equally possessed, shared, and consumed by all. Every day, you use it. I use it. Your neighbour uses it. No one gets more and no one gets less. Twenty-four hours for everybody. No one has an unfair advantage. You, me, we all have 24 hours to consume, expire, and spend
- You Are Not in Your School Anymore.
- the real world is a different animal altogether. There are no syllabuses, no semesters, no annual tests.So if you don’t already have your bigger and smaller goals figured out, you are screwed.
- And once you have found your goals, now you must build an effective system around them. Then, back them up with consistent effort over some time.
- It might not feel much rewarding at first, but when you follow a clear goal, use a robust system, and build upon work over the years, sooner or later, you get the compound interest
- They were doing the same things before and after they achieved momentum. Their habits, disciplines, routines, and consistency were the keys that unlocked momentum for each. And they became unstoppable when Big Mo showed up to their party.
- Time-Management Isn’t the Main Hero
- “You can work in a restaurant 80 hours a week, and you are not gonna get rich. It’s about knowing what to do and knowing who to do it with and when to do it.”
- “I would say that the most important skill to get rich is to become a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. There should be no book in the library that scares you.”
- When you rely on your simple skills, you make yourself easily replaceable. It’s because if anyone can do your job, you don’t have any exceptional value.
- The only way to make yourself harder to replace is to step up your game. And the fastest way to do that is to upskill yourself.
- “Make a freaking impact and start providing value! Let money come to you! Look around outside your world, stop being selfish, and help your fellow humans solve their problems. In a world of selfishness, become unselfish.”

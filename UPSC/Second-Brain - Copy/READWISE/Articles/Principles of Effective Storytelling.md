Weave in the Emotion
Emotion is what makes great stories stick.
Think about your favorite stories. How did they make you feel? It’s a safe bet that they elicited a strong emotional response - positive or negative.
Take it one step further. Watch your favorite movie. Using emojis in a note document, map out your emotions (and the strength of each) that you are feeling at various points throughout during the movie. Your note doc may look something like this:  ^285013401

Keep It Simple

“Make it simple, but significant.” - Don Draper

A good story may be complex, but a great story is always simple.
One way to test your story: Try to elevator pitch the story to an uninformed party. Are they able to understand it? Could they repeat it back to you or share it with a friend in a similarly simple manner? If not, you still have work to do.
When in doubt, simplify!

Suspend Reality
Disney is the greatest storytelling empire of all time. They have the best IP in the world, but more importantly, they do more with that IP than anyone can imagine.
Walt Disney was famous for his focus on suspending reality for his audiences - allowing them to experience his new reality while still being in their reality.

“There’s always room for a story that can transport people to another place.” – J.K. Rowling

Take a lesson from the best. Suspend reality.
(Note: This thread from my friend Trung Phan dives deep on some of Disney’s insane commitments to storytelling at their theme  ^285013404

The story you tell has to be catered to the audience to whom  ^285013406

shared membership in a group, or shared experience. Stories that build communities last forever.
Note: As many of you will undoubtedly point out, this one is a double-edged sword. Some of the most terrible dictators and leaders in history used storytelling to foster a community aligned with their aims. It cuts both ways - it can be a force for good or a force for evil.

Create Contrasts
Storytelling expert Nancy Duarte coined the simple “what is vs. what could be” framework for creating contrasts in your stories. This framework forces you to create contrasts to craft a captivating narrative.
First, describe the reality (“what is”). Next, describe the potential future (“what could be”). The audience will want to lean in - to understand why the world is not the way it could be. They will become invested in that potential future (because it is so different from the reality you portrayed).
You have them - now you can take them along on that journey with you!  ^285013409

What is the story trying to achieve? What does success look like with this story? Do you have a burning desire to tell this story? If so, why?
If your answers to these questions are loose or dynamic, you’re going to have a difficult time capturing your audience from the start. The audience feeds off of your commitment and clarity. If you are lacking either, they will feel it. Guaranteed.
Commit to answering these key questions before doing anything else  ^285013410

Establish Structure  ^285013414

.

If you are struggling to establish structure, try using “the story spine” framework, first created by playwright Kenn Adams. It goes like this:

Once upon a time there was [blank]. Every day, [blank]. One day [blank]. Because of that, [blank]. Until finally [bank].

It has helped me more times than I can count. Fill it in and watch your story take  ^285013415

Novelty comes in many different forms: Fresh, new perspectives. Surprising insights. Shock-and-awe moments. Unexpected twists.
Novelty is what makes your audience say: “Oh, wow!” It is what catches them off-guard, what distances them from their linear ways of thinking. It immediately signals that this isn’t like anything they have seen, read, or experienced before.
Are you meeting this burden? If you’re falling short, dig deeper.  ^285013416

Make It Shareable
Stories are meant to be shared.
The story “K-factor” - a viral marketing metric for growth - should be high. The K-factor is defined as the number of “invites” sent by each customer (or audience member) multiplied by the conversion of these invites.
So what you really want to see is an audience that is naturally evangelizing your story with their individual communities. Stories with high K-factors spread like a wildfire.
This requires high shareability. To enhance the shareability of your story: Keep it simple and make it easy to “take down” into shorter, alternative versions.

Draft Fast, Edit Slow
Most great writers and storytellers agree on one thing: starting is the hardest part.
There is nothing more daunting than a blank page. The key: start fast, but edit slow.
Get a draft down quickly - don’t worry about how bad it is. Just get it down. Then slow down - edit, write, and rewrite as necessary.
This tactic will allow you to get past “blank page anxiety” and just get moving. Remember, a body in motion tends to stay in motion!


So those are 10+ principles of effective storytelling that you can start using today. If you do take the leap and start using them, I guarantee you’ll unlock growth across the diverse realms of your life.

# Highlights 
Let's face it, we love productivity! As a culture, we have a seemingly unending appetite for viral articles on productivity hacks  ^288468545

---

Given that we live in a paradigm of time scarcity, who doesn't want to get more done in less time?  ^288468546

---

This all has a hidden cost. Too much optimization leads us into a trap.  ^288468547

---

The productivity trap.  ^288468548

---

there is only so much more "productivity" we can squeeze out of the day before things get counterproductive.  ^288468549

---

Other times, focusing so much on efficiency makes me feel like I'm rushing through life and not fully experiencing it.  ^288468550

---

becoming more productive doesn't make our life less busy. It just turns up the treadmill speed and creates even more work and makes us even more frantic. Thank you for that, Parkinson's Law!  ^288468551

---

Sometimes the best way to do something better is not to achieve our current goals; it's to transcend them and think from another paradigm.  ^288468552

---

Learning is the ultimate productivity.  ^288468553

---

our knowledge is cumulative and builds upon itself. Therefore, the results of the learning approach are exponential.  ^288468554

---

The seven-hour rule  ^288468555

---

Spend seven hours per week (one hour per day) focused on learning, just like Ben Franklin did. Make it a core habit, just like exercise.  ^288468556

---

if you spend an hour a day reading, you'll read 52 more books per year. Just one book can change your life if it's the right book at the right time. So, imagine the power of 52?  ^288468557

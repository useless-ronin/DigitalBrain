## Highlights
- Somehow the day ticks by and then it’s 11 pm and you still haven’t done the thing and it feels like you might as well go to bed and start over tomorrow, but already you have a sinking horrible sense that you won’t do it then either. And lo, the cycle repeats.
- Why wouldn’t you feel self-loathing when every day you violate a promise you made to yourself about something important to you AND you don’t know why AND you can’t stop AND you have no one else to blame because YOU ARE DOING IT ALL TO YOURSELF for some mysterious fucking reason you don’t even understand?
- we’re lazy, we’re unproductive, we’re irresponsible, we’ve let ourselves become addicted to our phones, we’re procrastinators, we’re not meditating, blah blah blah
- Basically whatever is keeping us from doing the thing is something that’s wrong with us or our behaviour, something that needs to be controlled, eradicated, tamed, left behind or put in its place.
- that way of thinking about the problem is not accurate, and it’s definitely not fucking useful
- You are not lazy. You are not undisciplined. You are not irresponsible. You are not suffering from mysterious ‘Just Can’t Do It’-itis.
- And internal resistance is not a flaw, nor is it all powerful. It is a facet of human creativity and growth, and it can be managed. But we have to start by recognising it for what it is.
- the force that keeps us from using our talents “the Resistanc
- t is grows from the exact same soil as every talent and skill and goal we have: our brains, our personal history, our families and our culture.
- Because that soil is unique to each of us, every person’s internal resistance has its own particular causes and flavours and effects.
- Internal resistance is an attempt to avoid the pain we associate with successfully doing the thing.
- The causes of this pain are as individual as we are, but in my experience it is usually tied to some kind of predicted loss of love and connection, whether it’s love from others or for ourselves
- What can you do with your internal resistance?
- Internal resistance is not lazy — it’s fucking energetic as hell! It takes a lot of work to push back on our desire to move toward our goal, day after day
- if we try to use discipline to increase our movement toward the goal, we wind up with another version of the same problem, because we ultimately increase the resistance: the more likely it looks like we’re going to make it to the finish line, the greater the fear and the stronger the resistance.
- we’re already locked in a mental tug of war, and trying to apply discipline just means both sides pull harder
- 1. Recognise that internal resistance is on your
- internal resistance does not want to destroy us; it literally wants the opposite! It only exists to protect us from pain.
- You just have two deeply rooted and fundamentally contradictory ideas about what is best for you: doing the thing, and not doing the thing.
- 2. Get curious about this pain that your brain is so worried about
- When we understand exactly what pain we fear and why, we can work on reducing those fear
- 3. Negotiate. You may not be able to figure out what is motivating your internal resistance immediately, and even once you do, it can take some time to figure out how to address your fears and worries about pain in the offing
- You can create so much increased space in your brain just moving from “I need to apply will power so I stop being so bad and lazy” to “I’m experiencing a lot of internal resistance, let me get inventive in working with it today”.
- 4. Recognise that you are not alone in this
- there are rare people who do not — or at least don’t seem to — experience much internal resistance, who seem to just produce and produce. But I am willing to bet that you also seem like that kind of person to someone in your life.
- Listening to your resistance
- . It holds a lot of knowledge about what we secretly believe we might be able to do
- it’s exhausting and sad because it feels like whichever side wins, part of you will lose. But that’s why we work to understand the internal resistance
- Sometimes the fears turn out to be imaginary, and sometimes the pain is very real. But either way, they become just one part of the experience of doing the thing we want to do, rather than a barrier to doing it in the first place.

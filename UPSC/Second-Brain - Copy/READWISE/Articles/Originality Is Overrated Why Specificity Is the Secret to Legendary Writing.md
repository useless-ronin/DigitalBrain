## Highlights
- The advice to “be original” is just a different way of saying “be authentic,” which are both vague ways of saying “be yourself,” which is akin to giving the guidance of breathing. “Just breathe,”
- Instead of thinking “How can I be original?” or “How can be authentic?” it’s much more productive to ask, “How can I be more specific?”
- Specificity means being explicit about why you’re saying what you’re saying — and what outcome can or should be generated as a result.
- Specificity is clarity, and clarity is all that matters.
- Stop trying to be original. Start trying to be more specific.
- “You should write every day” is vague advice. More specificity here would be, “When you write every day, you are actively practicing the habit of keeping promises to yourself. The more promises you keep, the more trust you build, the more consistent you become, the more prolific you get.”
- “Confidence is about being happy” is vague advice. More specificity here would be, “Confidence is about accepting all the things within yourself that make you feel uncomfortable — because as you become comfortable standing in what makes you different, you become comfortable with ‘not fitting in.’ And in our society, we perceive people who are OK with ‘not fitting in’ as confident.”
- “Relationships take work” is vague advice. More specificity here would be, “Lasting relationships require both parties to give up many of their own selfish wants and needs for the good of the unit — while simultaneously making their own selfish wants and needs known so they feel heard, understood, appreciated, and accepted in that letting-go process.”
- having a 100% completely original idea requires a lifetime of work aimed in a *specific* direction

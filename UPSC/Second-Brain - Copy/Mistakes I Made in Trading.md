p# Avoid These Mistakes at All Cost
- ***Not knowing my precise entry point and exit point***
- ***Going into live market without pre-analysis***
	- The market will suck you in and tempt to make emotional trades
	- Jumping into trades randomly
	- Not looking for key areas or areas of confluence, instead taking trades in the middle of movement
- ***Over leveraging my trades***
- ***Not setting stop loss***
	- Stop loss getting hit by the volatility
- ***Risking more than I can afford to loose***
- ***Thinking of making quick gains( Believing there is actually such thing as get-rich quick schemes)***
	- Get rich-quick schemes are the fastest ones to make you poor.
- ***Not having patience.***
- ***Not following a plan or strategy.***
- ***Enter after retesting the breakout. Don't trade without confirmation***
- **Don't trust the price action of weekend. Stay calm, and away from market on weekends.**
- Trade with one-time frame and stick to it. 
	- If you trade with 4 hour, don't lower time frame. 
	- If you trade with 15 min, don't go higher. 
- **Don't try to time and beat the market**
	- When the market is in downtrend, look for shorting opportunities on a bounce back. When the market is in uptrend look for buying opportunities on a pullback.
- **Don't Sell at support and don't buy at resistance**
	- Don't trade what you think will happen. Trade what's happening in the market. 
	- Don't buy after a big rally and don't sell after a bloodbath. 
***Don't Trade on HOPE. IT'S DANGEROUSLY DANGEROUS.***

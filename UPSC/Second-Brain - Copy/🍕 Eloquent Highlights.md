How this learner got the attention of a famous venture capitalist… - prakashjoshipax@gmail.com - Gmail

-   There are many paths to building your credibility and audience online.
    

-   There’s a sea of experts touting different strategies, hacks, platforms, mediums. And, they often convince us why their specific approach is the best, without really backing up their claims.
    
-   Instant Credibility: The Power Of Curation
    
-   Curating and summarizing what you’ve learned from others is powerful for one reason.
    
-   It helps you leverage the best of other people’s ideas. Ideas that have gone viral, and have stood the test of time.
    
-   Rather than putting your untested ideas out there and risking a higher failure rate, you start with a safer and arguably more effective approach.
    

-   The brutal truth is that people have the option to listen to you OR the best person in the world on any given topic. Who will they listen to?
    
-   How can you speed-build your credibility like they did?
    
-   Here’s a simple format you can copy:

Any Successful, Day and Swing traders? How’d you do it? : stocks

-   Trading is more about limiting losses than making gains. You absolutely cannot get crushed on a single trade. Have a downside target and get out when/if that get hits. There will ALWAYS be another trade.
    
-   You’re not going to be right 100% of the time. Knowing that, and getting ego out of the way is the only way to be successful. Admitting you’re wrong is HARD, but once you can do that consistently you will see wins more consistently.
    
-   Let’s say you’re right 50/50. If you cut losers early, and let winners run (scale out) you can and will be profitable.
    
-   Stay away from day trading. It's a nasty habit to pick up and most people aren't cut out for it. Swing tradings a lot less work and typically safer
    
-   My advice is:
    
-   The best trading comes from companies that slowly go up long term, but trade "flat" over the medium term with stable tops and bottoms
    
-   It's a common mistake to think that companies have to constantly be going up to make money, when the opposite couldn't be truer. You also can't go wrong with swing trading safer companies with lower volatility, especially when you're new. Those are the companies you can safely hold if things go south.
    
-   Don't get married to a single stock. This is a rookie mistake
    
-   There's going to be plenty of moments where stocks just don't make sense to trade, typically when they're outside of a predictable trading range(such as breaking a support or resistance) or if it's just not at a good price within the trading range. Do not force trades that don't make sense because you think you need to trade constantly
    
-   Following that, sometimes you just have to say fuck it and take a stock out of your watchlist because it's no longer favorable to trade within your strategies.
    
-   . The market is always changing and favorable companies can and will become unfavorable.
    
-   If you're trying to get 10% swings constantly you need to curb your expectations. 3-5% is much more reasonable and can be achieved faster as most stocks have +/- 1-3% volatility. Reliable profits always beat occasional large profits
    
-   essie Livermor
    
-   **Do you trying to get in right at the breakout? Or do you like to wait until a new support level has been established at the old resistance level?**
    
-   There’s two ways I like to enter a new trade. Let’s say the range of consolidation is between 40 and 45. If it hits 40 and just goes straight up to 45 and breaks through I’d rather enter on a retest of 45.
    
-   Enter right on the breakout without any retest or a second higher low on this type of move
    
-   The problem with waiting for a retest is that you miss the strongest moves
    
-   Stocks that perform the best most of time will breakout and run. It won’t give you a chance to enter on any sort of retest. This realization is what made me profitable because if you only trade the retest of a breakout you are essentially limiting yourself to the stocks with the weakest moves.
    
-   After trading breakouts for a while you will understand what to expect on price movements once it breakouts. Weakness of a move can many times be spotted within the first couple days and can be sold due to you predicting that this move will be weak and not worth keeping your money in even at a small gain. Study charts religiously. Look at the charts of stocks with the largest gains and see what they looked like at the beginning of their moves, half ways through, and at the end. Look at what to expect for a gain after a breakout too. A basic rule I have is a stock will move up the range it previously ran up before consolidation. Ex. Stock goes from 20-30 then consolidates. When it breaks out I’d aim for a 10$ move. I’d be looking for weakness throughout the move in case I decide to take profits and leave the trade early.
    
-   I personally like to choose swing trading, and I can choose trading with higher profitability based on my own experience; less pressure than daily trading, no need to pay attention to the chart all day; more patience and stronger principles are required. If you have enough experience. You can choose counter-trend trading
    
-   personal suggestion:
    
-   1. Limit losses. Always remember to use stop loss.
    
-   2. False breakthroughs and divergence will increase profitability. False breakouts are good swing trading signals, especially when there is a bullish or bearish divergence between oscillators and prices.
    
-   3. Charts with a longer period of use.
    
-   Charts below 4 hours are not recommended, but a small time period chart can be used to determine the entry and exit points.
    
-   4. Don't be afraid of market news. Important market reports are catalysts for volatility.
    
-   Only way to be successful is to take all the panic out of it.
    
-   **If you can’t survive a year where the indexes are negative then you won’t make it.**
    
-   The last year EVERYBODY looks like a genius but a lot are going to find out in the next few years it’s not typically this easy……
    
-   Markets are all about Risk Management, Technical analysis and Fundamental analysis. Build a strategy that works or learn from somebody that has a strategy that has held the test of time. ( At least 1 Bear Market )
    
-   I day trade mostly exclusively and yes always stick to a plan.
    
-   Take profit and scale profit: sounds easy right? Wrong! Catch a .60-.70 cent mover and you want more! Greed got me for a long while but green is green. Scale out on your indicators and hold a few shares for lotto purposes but take your damn money.
    
-   Buy the rumor, sell the news:
    
-   Rumors though seem to always follow by a spike this one has saved my ass on multiple occasions.
    
-   It's not necessarily rumours in the typical sense. For example let's say investors are saying earnings are expected to be good so the stock price increases leading into earning release (buying the rumour). Then even if earnings are good the stock still drops afterwards (selling the news). This type of thing happens often.
    
-   Simply put, you do the research, lot's of it is in fact speculation, but ultimately, you need to get in early and exit with a specified and calculated strategy (i.e. sell limits you don't touch). If you get greedy, you will fail, I can promise you that.
    
-   10-20% profit is fantastic and adds up quickly. Sure people get lucky and get 100-300% return in a month, (Wallstreetbets) but once luck runs out, strategy is the only thing that survives.
    
-   Buy dips, not momentum.
    
-   Swing trading is easier than day trading.
    
-   Do DD, lots of it. Add them to your watchlist and watch to see when it dips. On days when they have dips, buy and hold.
    
-   When you want to take profits, sell
    
-   I set my rule as 30% or more total gain and sell.
    
-   Micro ND small cap companies are easy for swing trading but very volatile that you have to track every day.
    
-   Be very careful buying shares out of FOMO. Biggest mistake
    
-   Biggest mistakes I make are when I go chase a stock after selling and seeing it rocket. The rocket always seem to fall the very next day and continue downtrend for a week until it goes up again. You can't really time the market so don't kick yourself for missing out on a few. There are other opportunities to invest in.
    
-   Day trading is a nightmare, swing trading is easy. You know what you do? A lot of research, and learn to hold your fucking nuts and don't be a bitch.
    
-   You’re wasting your time and I’ve got 40 years experience. It was hard to impossible 20 years ago but the market is much harder now. Humans can’t beat a computer at chess, poker, go, jeopardy etc. it’s just to much better at exploiting any edge you think you have.
    
-   Day trading is a nightmare, swing trading is easy. You know what you do? A lot of research, and learn to hold your fucking nuts and don't be a btch.
    
-   It’s all about strategy, analysis and understanding. There is a reason why a „trader” in most investments banks is only responsible for sending orders. It’s because making trades is the least important thing in trading. Most of the time is spent on analysis and development of a plan.
    
-   I started journaling and day trading this past June. I've been learning to look at candle stick charts - volume and price movement. It can seem overwhelming at first but pick one stock and watch it's chart throughout the day, especially if it's a momentum stock.
    
-   Don't overwhelm yourself with MACD, VWAP, Support and Resistance. Just stick with the candle chart until your familiar enough to see what they mean in relation to price moves. It'll start to make sense after a bit of time.
    
-   Like others said, minimize losses. Have price targets for profit and losses. Leave ego at the door.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/jzrn00/how_many_hours_a_day_did_you_put_in_while/

-   Premarket prep - 1 hour Trading - 1 hour Journaling / Review- 1 hour Eduction (books, videos, ...) - 3 hours
    
-   bout 6 hours total per day with an 8 hour shift in between journaling and education.
    
-   I’ve narrowed down to just a single strategy - opening range breakout. I now spend 30 mins in pre market, narrow down to 3 stocks for the open. I’m normally all out of my positions within the first 10 mins.
    
-   I don’t even count it now. Trading has become a lifestyle for me and it’s had many ups and downs. Overall I’ve put in hundreds of hundreds of hours, but now that I have my strategy in place and have it down to a science, I only have to trade for an hour at most a day.
    
-   In the beginning of trading, a lot of time was spent studying up and coming penny stocks and looking for “hype” to get into early for a potential two week holding period. Panned out successfully with a few trades (Remark holdings, MVIS, ZOM, etc)
    
-   After a long time of messing with penny stocks and losing out due to holding to long or entering too late, I looked into technical analysis and trading formations. That was several weeks of studying and practical application. I used technical formations to call some decent drops on MRNA that turned $2000 into $11k in two days. I also bought very short dated options and was very stupid so didn’t sell and capture the profit. Huge regrets. But that’s what led me to learning about swing trading and understanding VWAP/bollinger band bounces. That was another few weeks of studying.
    
-   When I am not trading, I will use think or swims on demand feature to practice my strategy on different tickers and time frames so I can stay sharp on my execution and prediction of the trade. I generally skip to days where entries are shown and I deliberately avoid looking at the chart (only looking at my indicator showing a very specific trend) and then I practice from there. That is something I do about 2-3 hours a week outside of my actual trades.
    
-   2 hours everyday for 1 year, after 1 year I started trading, now its aboutb1 hour of a mix of things, watch a few analysis videos, look at my reddit which is only investing related things and TA. Then I analyze the market and a few certain tickers,
    

I managed to 10x my investment this year and loss it all last week. TBH i got greedy.

i was quite green there too but a couple bad trades and ignoring sl cost me too much .

Professional Retard right here boyos

It's a pattern man. Greed comes right after some winning streaks.

You paid the learning tax to market.

self realization tax

Disabled the options today only. Was feeling sad af. Feeling better after seeing your post. Had earned quite good with options and now all my profits from both equities n options are wipped out. Long term investing zindabaad.

I feel like everyone goes through same phases. First they makes lots of profit and start to take bigger risks. And eventually loses everything. Same happened with me

I lost 80% of my swing trading profits of the year. About 8 lakhs within 3 weeks of Intraday trading. Greed drove me and that's when market wins. Calm, sensible and patient trader is the best trader bois.

I used to do swing trading for about 3 years and was profitable. Started trading options when markets became too volatile about 3 months ago. (I knew how to make money selling options beforehand but the market looked good for swing trades so I was sticking to it)

-   his is a tough market for most traders and I'm pretty sure the last 2 months have been bad for most swing traders and option sellers. Intraday players and options buyers have made good money in this period. However, the beauty of options is that if you know the game well enough, you can devise a strategy for any kind of market.
    
-   Try paper trading, learn more about options and try option selling instead of buying if that's what you've been doing.
    
-   I've personally made 6% returns selling options from November 1 till date (nowhere near Twitter screenshot traders but I'm more than happy with 4% a month) and this was in a very bad market for options sellers where vix was going haywire.
    
-   The problem with swing trading is that it works well in bullish and in low volatility sideways markets. I found this out the hard away in March - April 2021 period.
    
-   A rise in vix offers good opportunities in option selling if you know how to trade volatility. I personally get out of my swing trades in such times and switch to options almost immediately after hitting consecutive stop losses on swing trades.
    
-   I've seen that no strategy works in all kinds of markets so you just need to master a few strategies for different markets and be fluid in identifying and switching when the time comes.
    
-   Fellow swing trader here. Don't lose hope, been through a rough ride too. Lost a lot of money, then doubled it in like 5 months and the last two months were terrible, back to where I was 5 months ago. It's very stressful, but it's a part of the journey of being a trader
    
-   Bhai ek baad yaad rkhiyo first time mistake hojaati h par agar isko repeat kroge toh voh addiction ban jaega. You know what I mean don't do lvg and options and stand on your words like a man cause this shit fucks hard and there is no way back
    

https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/fw82ow/after_2_years_of_daytrading_7_months_full_time/

-   I’ve been seeing lots of questions about people wanting to learn trading. Have received an influx of messages asking how to get started/go full time.
    
-   I’ve been asked what strategy/books/courses/indicators etc. there is that are good. I’ve read over 50+ books (ebooks and hard cover) on day trading:
    
-   •#1: 90% of books are fluff. Of all of these. Only about 10% of it were great pieces of info.
    
-   •#2: I don’t use indicators. They lag. Ever since I dropped them, my trading became less stressful and way easier to manage. Price does 2 things. Up or down. You don’t need 5 indicators telling you what direction it’s indicating. It’s called Pattern Day Trading. Not Indicator Day Trading. Not News Day Trading. Trade the candles. If indicators work for you. Keep on running them!
    
-   •#3: The overall market condition (Bull/Bear/Stagnant) has no effect to a day trader’s equity curve. We trade patterns. We don’t hold overnight. We became day traders because we can take advantage of either direction especially in the immediate. I know my pattern works 47% of the time with 3:1 pay out. (I lose $100 or I profit $300. No more, no less; every single time)
    
-   Of 100 trades. 47 trades I profit. 53 trades I lose.
    
-   I risk $100 per trade. Why do I choose 3:1? I’d win more trades if I was 2:1. Why not 4:1? Because my pattern pays the most with 3:1. I found this by computerized backtesting and manual backtesting. Can you mentally handle being up 2.75:1 then watching it hit back to your StopLoss? Trust your edge/statistic. And document your work relentlessly!
    
-   #4: You need to write a business plan.
    
-   Not some 2 page Word document of. “I will buy when this indicator says this. This has worked in my backtesting 60% of the time. Here's some screenshots"
    
-   •#5: This is the most BORING job you will ever have!
    
-   I trade 3 patterns. I have to wait for a lot of prerequisites to be met before I even consider looking at a chart. Out of 7,500 stocks. My strategy has my watch list distilled to 3-5 stocks every morning. And I wait. And watch. Waiting for a pattern. And so many times, 1 out of my 3 patterns is about to form... and the candle printing will pullback too much. Or print with more volume than the previous. Making the trade VOID per my business plan.
    
-   There are days I don’t trade. (1 or 2 times a month this happens). A business plan helped me not care I don’t trade those days, it accounts for that, or if a price kept rising or falling after I sold or covered. Or if my stop loss was hit by 2¢. 3:1 every trade, no questions asked. Trust your edge
    
-   BONUS:
    
-   Think of the expenses.
    
-   If you trade equities. 25k minimum. (You want minimum 30k due to draw-downs). A lightning fast computer. Lots of RAM. A decent CPU. I have 64GB of RAM and an i9 9900k CPU. No you don't need a bunch of monitors, I wanted a sick office though!
    
-   Don’t forget:
    
-   •Mortgage/rent
    
-   •Car note ( I sold 2 of my pride and joys. I owned both but liquidated them to get into this business )
    
-   •Groceries
    
-   •Car insurance
    
-   •Health insurance
    
-   •Dental insurance
    
-   •Taxes on the house
    
-   •Wi-Fi (Add cable if you want)
    
-   •Use a scanner? Add that
    
-   Hobbies. Find cheap ones. I hit up the golf range, shoot trap, and lift weights. You'll be bored when you're done trading at 10AM with 10 hours left in the day.
    
-   Get a part time job or have a side business that has NOTHING to do with trading for your sanity's sake.
    
-   Move in with a friend to split rent if you’re single and young, go back home and live with your parents if you can handle that
    
-   The learning curve is brutal and you must be patient. Shrink your liabilities and expenses. You will pay homage to get into this business 1 way or another unless you’re just given a lot of money.
    
-   Trading is easy. It's the mentality required that separates the 95% from the 5% successful.
    
-   rading has been a wild experience. I've met people at the gym who are well off and I've shared my account statements/business plan with.
    
-   Don't buy guru courses that sell some crazy lifestyle on YouTube ads with rented private jet photoshoots, rented Lambos and AirBNB houses they rent for the day. If they were so great at trading. They'd start their own funds!
    
-   od strategy when you're waiting for your setup's to hit.
    
-   Depending on the personality of the individual it can take a long time to develop that patience to go with it.

-   this post is for those who take trading seriously, who harbor real hopes of earning a steady income in the market. This post is going to be long, and it is going to demand work from you to both understand and attempt to emulate. But that work will be worth the effort. I recommend you read it several times through, and keep as a reference. If you are just here looking for entertainment and gambling, that is fine, but this is probably a thread to skip.
    
-   Four weeks ago I began a challenge to turn $4k into $1M. I began this to help educate others on the professional trading process, and to prove several points that are often in contention:
    
-   1) That it can be done,
    
-   2) That good trading is actually simple,
    
-   3) That technical analysis is real and effective,
    
-   4) That small accounts have a huge edge.
    
-   The question you should be asking yourself is: How did I find so many sudden, big winners in a single week? I will teach you exactly how below.
    
-   a lot of you will disagree with these points, but some of you will benefit a lot from hearing it. These are some of the reasons you aren't making money, in my not so humble opinion.
    
-   1) Stop chasing stupid memes and "hot" stocks. Create your own opportunities.
    
-   Everyone just copying what others tell them to trade, so few actually thinking for themselves or finding their own trades and opportunities.
    
-   Maybe you looked at the fundamentals and you thought it was a great company with long term prospects. Ok, sure. But if you are trading on fundamentals, why the hell are you buying short term options?
    
-   If you are a fundamental trader then you are a buy and hold investor with a year plus timeline.
    
-   f you are buying weeklies or looking for a quick pop, fundamentals don't mean shit, technicals are what matter.
    
-   Stop mixing long term strategy with short term trading, it just doesn't make any sense.
    
-   Set up your own scanners. Do your own research. Find your own opportunities.
    
-   But chasing memes or pump and dumps is not going to make you money long term.
    
-   2) Stop trading slow as fuck megacap stocks with a small account.
    
-   The reason you can beat the market hard with a small account is because you can trade the highest beta stocks that guys like Buffett can't. But only if you focus on them.
    
-   Trade the fast stocks. The stocks that really move hard. Those are the stocks that will get you rich quickly, not fucking BABA on a 2% move.
    
-   Average Daily Range. If your account is less than a million, you should not even be looking at stocks with an ADR less than 5%. They are too slow
    
-   If it is less than 4 or 5 ADR, I tell them it is dog shit, whether I'm bullish on it or not.
    
-   3) If you want to gamble with options, then go for it. But if you want to be an actual professional trader, you probably shouldn't touch options until you've shown consistency with shares first.
    
-   if you just want to gamble and hope to get lucky, knowing you will probably go broke, that's fine with me. That's the WSB way. At least you are being honest with yourself.
    
-   But if you want to get serious about trading, to make so much money so consistently you never have to work again, you should not be touching options until you've proven you can be consistently profitable trading shares.
    
-   Leverage and margin is something that ought to be earned, not used just because it is there.
    
-   Options are extremely unforgiving. Let's say you buy a stock at 10, it rallies up to 12, then tanks back to 10 again, and you sell. With shares, you've just broken even. Not good, but obviously not bad either. Breakeven is fine for a trade. But do the same exact trade with options instead of shares, and you could be down 20% on it. Good luck overcoming that downward pressure as a noobie trader long term. Trading is hard enough without adding theta and vega rape to the mix.
    
-   4) If you want to be a professional, then think and act like a professional.
    
-   Professional traders are process oriented. They are focused on improving their trading process more than they are on chasing the hot next trade.
    
-   That means having a method or system to your trading. Something you can repeat again, and again, and gradually improve.
    
-   It also means you have to work fucking hard. Success is rarely easy, much less in something as competitive as the stock market. If you are lazy, or don't want it enough, be honest with yourself.
    
-   So learn it, and practice it, and start making money. From there, the rest is improvement, and branching out, and finding new strategies to test and perfect on your way to becoming an independent, professional trader. In other words, the rest is gravy.
    
-   A lot of people will tell you technical analysis is nonsense and doesn't work. Those people do not know what they are talking about. I've made my living as a purely technical trader, and I assure you I am not the only one. Over my career I've picked far too many huge short term winners using nothing but charts for it to be simple luck.
    
-   We are going to look for strong, volatile momentum stocks that are breaking out of a consolidation pattern.
    

What do these charts all have in common?

-   1) Strong momentum stocks. Every one of these (except CRCT which was a recent IPO) had doubled or more in the past six months. None of this buy low, sell high stuff here. We want to buy high and sell highe
    
-   2) High ADR (Average Daily Range). You want to trade the fast stocks, the truly explosive stocks, and a high ADR is one of the best ways to find them. The average ADR on these five stocks was above 8%. Our minimum ADR will be 5%.
    
-   3) Consolidation. The stock made a big move upward, and then began trading sideways with a tightening range. Forming higher lows and lower highs. The ideal flagging pattern we are looking for is technically referred to as a "pennant."
    
-   4) Moving Averages. Every one of these stocks was either riding or bouncing off of their 20 day simple moving average. There is something truly magical about that yellow line on my charts, and I don't know what or why it is, but it simply works.
    
-   to avoid stocks that are either too slow or over-extended, focus on those at or near the 20 SMA. Occasionally you can find good breakouts above the 20 SMA that are riding the 10 SMA, but these have a higher failure rate in my experience.
    
-   5) Strong breakout from their range on high volume. A "breakout" refers to a stock punching through the top of the consolidation flag you drew. Ideally you want to see fast rising price action on large volume. This is your entry point.
    

When is the best time to employ this strategy?

This strategy should only be employed during a rising bull market, or possibly during a sideways market. Breakouts will not work well in a declining market, and some other strategy must be employed.

The absolute best time for breakouts is shortly after a pullback in the market, when stocks begin to recover quickly. You can see some explosive moves during these periods.

How do you deal with breakouts that have gapped up in premarket?

Those are more difficult. It all depends on the price action. If something has gapped up huge in premarket, I will generally just pass on it. But if something is just starting to break out in premarket, I will look to enter. The exact percentage is difficult to say unfortunately, but anything up more than 10% is usually a pass for me.

What do you set your stop losses at?

Already explained above. First day, the lows of the day. Second day, cost basis. After that, use 10 day SMA as a trailing soft stop.

When do you take profits?

Already explained above. Take quarter to half profits after first big run up, usually around 3 to 5 days. Then use the 10 SMA as a soft trailing stop.

What if the stock gaps down hard overnight? My stop won't protect me from that!

This is true. The only way to avoid overnight risk is to be a pure day trader and to never hold overnight. Personally I find swing trading to be far more profitable, since the big moves take days to play out.

Swing trading also gives you much more time and freedom to live your life, since you can simply hold a winning position for days or even weeks, and don't have to sit and stare at a screen all day long to make money.

Stocks gapping down big overnight is actually quite rare, but eventually you will experience it.

This is not true at all, this strategy is based upon inherent market tendencies:

1.  Stocks with momentum tend to carry on in the same direction. (Go and study the past 100 years, stocks with 6 months momentum tend to carry on for the next 6).
    
2.  Volatility contraction. When stocks get in tight ranges it is showing that there is a buyer/seller balance, it will not take much buying to push the stock higher. Since we know that stocks with momentum tend to carry on in the same direction, we can assume that if a stock with momentum breaks out to the upside after a period of volatility contraction, it will more than likely carry on to the upside.
    
3.  Momentum bursts. Stocks move like staircases. They don't just go straight up, they go up for a few days, take a breather and move sideways, and then breakout and carry on higher.
    

If you can time your entries during a period of volatility contraction on stocks with momentum, you can get an entry with very low risk, giving you an asymmetrical risk trade.

-   The answer you’re looking for is: Keep your day job. Trade on the side.
    
-   Stock is side thing for now. No idea how some of those day traders do this as a day job.
    
-   It’s impossible to keep emotions out of your trading when you have to worry about making profits consistently so you can pay your bills! Emotions lead to mistakes, revenge trading, etc
    
-   A mechanic makes money by being a good mechanic. A doctor makes money by being a good doctor. A trader makes money by being a good trader.
    
-   If you can’t keep your emotions out of your trading you are, by literal definition, a bad trader. Anybody can keep their emotions out of their trading by having an actual trading plan and abiding by every single detail every single day. If you can’t do that, you’ll never be a good trader.
    
-   Successful trading is boring. There’s no emotions. You don’t give a shit about anything other than your trading plan. Market up? Market down? Doesn’t fucking matter because all that matters is your trading plan.
    
-   That is why you fail. Stop giving a shit about these piece of shit companies run by piece of shit executives. They don’t give a shit about you.
    
-   Make a full trading plan. Stick to the trading plan no matter what. Succeed
    
-   You find it challenging to keep your emotions at bay because you don’t have a trading plan. Averaging down is losing. Trading without a stop and a profit target is losing. Revenge trading? Revenge for what? Nobody did anything to you. You did it to yourself because you don’t have a trading plan.
    
-   Nobody should ever trade a single real penny until they have a proven strategy that includes entries and exits and a complete risk management plan that includes stops, profit targets, and position sizing. It’s written in pretty much every book in trading and I’m pretty sure all of Reddit completely ignores it.
    
-   Some of you guys think you can sit on 9-5 and also becoming a good trader, thinking of serving your paycheck master and learning how to trade 😀 can you really serve two masters ? Choose one and forget one
    

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/54v3n8/cryptotrading_advice_for_beginners/

-   Don't day trade at all and be patient. I held a nice stack on monero since the time it was worth 1.60 USD. I sold the half, after the third and final (so far) surge.
    
-   Read about the fundamentals, decide to get in or not and wait. You can make far more money with it,than tactical buy/sell. And more important:you can sleep good, if you have at least 30 percent bitcoin and the rest in 5 or more other promising blockchain tokens.
    
-   Think strategic not tactical. Crypto markets are crazy and manipulative.
    
-   I learned a lot, very quickly. When you're losing money, YOU LEARN VERY QUICKLY. Now, it's going up for me hehe.
    
-   Here are general advices.
    
-   -   Read A LOT, I mean A LOT. Know what you're investing in
        
    -   Know if you want to trade or if you want to invest, 2 very different ways of making money.
        
    -   Don't put all your money on one asset/currency.
        
    -   Margin long or sell is stressing, you WILL be stressed.
        
    -   You will lose, you will win.
        
    -   Have a good free margin
        
    -   Use stop loss
        
    -   Know how to read charts, but don't think that technical analysis makes everything
        
    -   Technical analysis doesn't make everything ! Check the fundamentals. If TA says BTC will be 650$ but big exchange gets hacked, expect a big dump.
        
    -   It's better to loose 200€ than 1000€
        
    -   It's better to loose 2000€ than 10000€
        
    -   Don't forget : when you buy for example ETH/BTC, if you're long on ETH, it implicitely means you're short on BTC ! You wouldn't want BTC to rise if you don't want your investments go downward.
        
    -   This one is controversial, I don't do it but it would have saved me time of stress: close your positions before night and close your positions before week-end if you want to enjoy it with yourself/friends/family.
        
    -   Controversial too, depends on the situation: don't buy when it's green, buy when it's red. Try to not buy on top, you will regret it, but buy before it goes to the top, you'll regret it too !
        
    -   Very important : Trading in crypto is WAR. You're a very little fish and whales will make the current. They will make you lose your head and sell when you shouldn't be selling.
        
    -   EDIT : If you don't close your positions, you don't gain anything, you don't loose anything (but I hope for you it's going upward !)
        
-   I hope it helps you. Good luck
    
-   Expect to blow out your account several times before you finally start to be consistently profitable -- there is no easy path in trading as it is a learned profession through practice and experience -- right now you are doing the equivalent of showing up to an NBA try-out asking for advise how to be the next LeBron James when all you did was play a pick up with guys after school and now you want to be pro -- there is nothing easy about trading good luck
    
-   If I had to go back in time and do one thing right. It would be to read Jesse Livermore's book first. Another is the return on trading is non-linear. It has nothing to do with daily growth or compounding interest. If the market doesn't move, you make no money. Don't think like a employer where X hours * Y Dollars an hour = pay. Stock trading is very far from that. Make good trades and money come. Don't think about profit first.

-   If you want to be someone on Twitter, you need to be someone outside of Twitter.
    
-   When people realize that you
    

-   They'll understand that you're not just another account (I call this proving your cocompetence)
    
-   You're someone. You have a story. And people LOVE stories:
    
-   your followers don’t even want perfect. They want real.
    
-   They crave a genuine connection with YOU.
    
-   And you establish it with
    

-   1. A scroll-stopping headline
    

-   2. A one-topic only, Call To Action to follow you
    

-   3. Good content
    
-   Notice how good content is third. That’s intentional.
    
-   what matters is how you PRESENT the thread
    

-   And stop the scroll.
    
-   Because what would you rather read?
    

-   ​
    

-   An exciting story on how a kid in a third world country overcame limitations and built a profitable business from his $300 Chromebook?
    
-   Or a thread on how to succeed?
    
-   A tear-jerking memoir on the 10 lessons you learned when 2020 decimated your 3-generatio
    
-   Or a thread on how the pandemic affected you?
    

-   ​
    
-   Growing an audience is like growing a business:
    

-   Every extra one gets significantly easier. You only have to figure it out once.
    

-   Grow an audience. Then use it to build whatever you want.
    
-   There's zero downside to growing an online audience. Your DMs get answered, people think you're smarter than you really are and attract WAY more business.
    
-   This opens up new opportunities:
    

-   1. Use it to boost people I genuinely believe in
    

-   2. Get them on an email list where I analyze the ads
    

-   3. Charge brands for sponsorships on said email list
    

-   And it takes me 5 minutes a day.
    

-   Unfair advantage.
    

He’s now part of the 99% of Twitter users who

Mindlessly scroll their time away

Make zero $$ from Twitter

Make zero connections from Twitter

Their lives GET WORSE every time

-they log in.

-   If you’re using Twitter every day, or even a few times a week…
    

-   and you’re NOT making money, gaining followers, or making connections…
    

-   Then I hate to break it to you… But you’re wasting your time.
    
-   Unfortunately, you are a part of that 99%. But you can change that very easily.
    
-   Just start posting some tweets, instead of mindlessly scrolling.
    

-   For me, it took 20,000 tweets before I saw any real progress.
    
-   Tweeting has led to me making incredible connections.
    

-   And that’s why I created The Twitter Winners Community, so tweeting can do the same for you.
    
-   It took me 40,000 tweets, hundreds of hours on calls, thousands of dollars in coaching and 2 years to get to what I know today.
    
-   The speed that allows tweets to go viral in your first couple months on Twitter.
    
-   You don't need 10,000 reps to get something right.
    
-   There are proven frameworks that build accounts, networks and bank accounts faster than what you’ve been trying

-   But if your tweets do one of these then they will perform."
    

-   ​
    
-   1) Relatability “I’ve gone through this.”
    
-   Humans are selfish. When they see something that they have gone through they can’t help
    
-   2) Call-Out - “I needed to hear that” / “fuck you’re right”
    
-   These tweets hurt because they pinpoint an activity that you know is not beneficial for you and you keep doing it.
    

-   ​ Or an activity you know you should do but you don’t.
    
-   3) Superiority
    
-   ​It makes you look superior in some way. It doesn’t say the other person is wrong, but it allows you to humble brag about your choices / the way you think.
    
-   4) Funny - makes you laugh
    
-   5) Perspective - makes you see how ridiculous something is
    
-   A fantastic way to make people engage is to show how a certain opinion is clearly superior to another one, but letting it you figure it out yourself.
    
-   Perspectives are great because once you position an argument a certain way, you ridicule the other opinion while making yours look clearly better.
    

-   ​
    
-   6) Hope
    
-   ​Helps you zoom out and makes your problems look small.
    

-   ​ It lets you know that whatever you’re worrying about is really not a big deal and actually
    
-   7) POV - “I’ve never thought about it this way before.”
    
-   ​Show people a certain point of view about a common topic that they haven’t thought about before.
    

-   ​ ​If you allow people to look at stuff from different angles they’ll engage
    
-   8) Implementing
    

-   ​Give people immediate advice that they can implement 5 minutes after they read your twe
    
-   9) Anger - “This also makes me angry.”

I know it’s my job, but Twitter sucks - prakashjoshipax@gmail.com - Gmail

-   People like to blame the government for how we are today. I blame social media. (even though it's my job lol)
    

-   45% of teenagers say they use it “almost constantly"
    
-   Teen suicide has risen with social media use (very strong correlation)
    

-   It’s shortening your attention span. It’s making you unable to focus
    
-   You're constantly being monitored by an algorithm. Which manipulates you into buying stuff you don't even want.
    

-   I want you to really look at your social media use, and think…
    
-   “What benefit is it giving me?"
    
-   You may have got some cool ideas and mindset shifts from money twitter.
    

-   You may have got brilliant health advice from various fitness influencers.
    

-   but is worth it?
    
-   Is it worth giving your time away just to get a dopamine hit?
    

-   How many times are you going to hear about steak being a superfood?
    

-   Or that you should make money while you're young? (duh)
    

-   After a certain point, it’s just tiring.
    
-   Twitter can be used to make boat loads of cash
    

-   It can be used to meet inspiring, like-minded people
    

-   You can get a stadium sized audience of people who love you, trust you, and want to buy from you in just months -- just by typing some words onto a screen.

-   Everything that works against the common Twitter user, works FOR us
    
-   They log in every day to get more isolated, manipulated, and unhappy.
    

-   We log in every day to build more connections, level up in life, and get the bag.

-   So if you’re going to use Twitter?
    
-   Either learn how to rig the algorithm
    
-   or
    

-   That same algorithm will destroy you in countless ways
    
-   it will take a while for you to figure out the app.
    

-   I tweeted 20,000 times before it finally “clicked”
    

-   But if I showed you everything I learned, it might only take you 100 tweets. Hell I've had people go viral on their third. You just need it to "click" like I'm gonna show you.
    
-   It’s “aha!” moments I had that made things “click” for me.

What Brazilian Jiu Jitsu taught me about Twitter - prakashjoshipax@gmail.com - Gmail

-   Breathing too hard. Trying too hard. Forcing too much. Those are all mistakes. Necessary mistakes, but mistakes nonetheless.
    
-   When was the last time you checked which of your tweets perform the best and just focused on what they tell you?
    

-   Why do we keep using new tactics when the old tactics work?
    

Maybe we're breathing too hard. Maybe we need to change the angle. Maybe this Twitter thing doesn't have to be a struggle. Maybe we're just using brute strength instead of leverage.

-   You want to get recognized by a niche first. Then expand to other areas second.

-   I tweet something and it gets 10,000 likes.

-   Out of those 10,000 people, maybe 5,000 see you.
    

-   Meaning you just gained 5,000 pairs of eyeballs for 3 seconds of work.
    
-   Twitter works a bit like YouTube. When people mindlessly watch a youtube video, they just read the comments instead.
    

-   And that's REALLY useful:
    
-   it gives you, the commenter, way more exposure than if you tweeted on your own.
    

https://www.dannyforest.com/blog/heres-my-exact-routine-and-process-as-a-full-time-writer-with-templates-you-can-use

1. Tweet more

3. Get email subs

4. Monetize said email subs

Here’s My Exact Routine and Process as a Full-Time Writer (With Templates You Can Use) — Danny Forest

Stop thinking this has to be hard. Just find the right angle and keep using it until it no longer works. Then you look for another trend. There's always another trend.

-   It’s not all about writing
    
-   That January was when I decided to write daily for a month, just so I could improve my written English.
    
-   Most of the articles were subpar (in hindsight), but I’ve improved quite drastically. I kept the habit in 2019 and 2020 and now I’m making it my full-time gig.
    
-   When I tried to figure out what’s next for me, there was only one thing I loved doing, could get paid for, was pretty good at, and that the world needs — good writing.
    
-   Writing is how I’ve consistently generated revenues since 2018. And that was by writing for only an hour a day. And now, with failed businesses and a newborn at my charge, I need more revenue.
    
-   when I decided to become a full-time writer, I had to think about what that even means. What do they do all day? No one ever told me.
    
-   I took a day to reflect on what my schedule would look like as a full-time writer.
    
-   My exact routine as a full-time writer
    
-   Habits
    
-   What’s an effective routine if not for good habits?! Let’s examine the habits I’m tracking daily:
    
-   The first thing I do when I wake up is to write. That’s when I’m most creative and my mind is sharpest. I’ve been doing that for almost three years now and it has been a game-changer for me. I now write for about 3.5 hours.
    
-   Then I do an intense workout.
    
-   After my workout (and shower), I practice three skills outside of my main thing.
    
-   Then I go for lunch, spend time with my family, power nap, and get back to writing usually around 3 pm.
    
-   I stop around 5 pm.
    
-   So that’s about 5.5 hours of writing in total.
    
-   The research just happens as part of my day-to-day life, based on what I do, what I read, and what I watch.
    
-   Writing headlines
    
-   One of the habits I mentioned above is writing headlines. It’s one of the best habits a full-time writer can have.
    
-   Writing headlines is tough, but also crucial. Becoming good at headlines is one of the best ways to get more views on your stories.
    
-   Finding a headline that has viral potential, isn’t complex and doesn’t make me want to vomit is a rare occurrence. I’m hoping that by coming up with 300 headlines every month, I’ll get better at it.
    
-   You don’t need to steal my routine and process, but you can get inspired by it and adapt it to your situation. You also don’t need to be a full-time writer to benefit from it.

-   A newsletter doesn’t seem smart. Anyone can create one. Email is nothing new. Yet a small number of us have unlocked the secret of why newsletters are so powerful.
    
-   No one is looking for more emails. Sorry.
    
-   Quit thinking your newsletter is better than hot sex.
    
-   The only two ways to succeed with a newsletter is to:
    
-   1.  Write the best newsletter on a topic
        
    1.  Curate the best content
        
    2.  If you can do one of these you’ll be wildly successful.
        
    3.  Use discount bias
        
    4.  Our brains are biased towards discounts. If something is cheaper then logic takes over. Everyone who buys a subscription from Polina goes for the yearly option as it’s more than 50% cheaper than monthly.
        
    5.  Once someone’s read your work for a year, they’ll probably stick with you long-term. But a subscriber who only commits for a month can easily love ya and leave ya.
        
    6.  A newsletter that costs money to subscribe to grows painfully slow
        
    7.  “Paywalled content isn’t shareable.”
        
    8.  I share an article with you via email. You click it. It takes you to a page and asks you for a credit card before you can read it. Most people will close the tab. Too much friction. Not enough information. No idea if the link is worth the money. And there’s so much good free content anyway.
        
    9.  Always start with a free newsletter.
        
    10.  It tests your skill and allows it to easily be shared online. As people share it, your subscriber numbers grow quickly.
        
    11.  There’s a way around the asking for money problem
        
    12.  For every 6 editions of your newsletter, make 4 free and only 2 able to be seen if a user pays the subscription.
        
    13.  Two other ways to make money from a newsletter
        
    14.  1. Sell one ad at the top of each edition
        
    15.  2. Place affiliate links in the email
        
    16.  An ad in a newsletter now gives them better ROI. If you own a newsletter, then guess what? The ball is now squarely in your court. This is a huge opportunity.
        
    17.  Growing a newsletter isn’t obvious
        
    18.  Find a newsletter you love, guest post in it, then link back to your newsletter at the top of the edition. The newsletter owner can then post in yours and link to theirs.
        
    19.  He says most Substack newsletters only grow through tweets.
        
    20.  Polina Marinova says if you want to grow a newsletter it’s best to do it through Tweet Threads — a series of tweets from an article with the last tweet being a link to the full story on Substack/Ghost/Beehiiv. (Example [here](https://twitter.com/polina_marinova/status/1509339355718070273?s=20&t=Cu6lb0q6rd1QNn6uTU5viA))
        
    21.  # Change the labels
        
    22.  Don’t call it a newsletter. Don’t call people subscribers.
        
    23.  If it sounds generic then we’ll ignore it.
        
    24.  Every company will eventually have a newsletter. But business is lazy AF. They won’t start newsletters. Nope.
        
    25.  What stops us starting newsletters…
        
    26.  We think our newsletter has to be unique or special. No way.
        
    27.  A powerful newsletter that people can’t resist delivers commentary with real style and personality. Anyone can do that. Even you.
        
    28.  The coolest part about a newsletter isn’t the money you can make. It’s the accountability it creates.
        
    29.  Readers will depend on you to show up. That builds an unstoppable writing habit. A writing habit will change your life in 52 weeks or less.
        
    30.  Maybe it’ll be the newsletter that creates your future success. Or perhaps a newsletter becomes the seed of your success. A newsletter allows you to be around what you’re passionate about. It’s forced learning. It involves free networking as part of the process.
        
    31.  A writing habit can change your life. Get leverage.

Market doesn't care about you. It doesn't know about you. It neither wants to take money away from you, it neither wants give you money. It is a free environment. 

It offers a completer freedom of expression with unlimited possibilites and risks. It is an unstructured environment. You are free to act per your will. 

THere are no rigid rules in the market. You are free to express yourself in unlimited ways. In an unstructured environment with unlimited possibilites, the less structure you create for yourself, the more you easily you will be swept away by the stronger forces.

if you want to stay for the long run, you have to make rules to guide your behaviour

A typical trader will do anything to avoid creating rules for himself to avoid responsibility for his trading. That's why 90% of the traders lose money. Because they try to avoid responsibility for the results of their action.They look for direction, assuming someone else must know something. If he makes money, he thinks he must have done something right, but he loses money, he can easily blame the market and other people.

When you make rules for yourself, you take responsibility for your actions and you attain some degree of self-control over yourself.

You have to make rules and abide by them. The difference between traders who make money consistently approach trading from the perspective of a mental discipline. Without self-discipline and emotional control, you can't make money in the market consistently.

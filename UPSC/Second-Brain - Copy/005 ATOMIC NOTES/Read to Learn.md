If you read to tell others how much you have read, you are doing it wrong. The purpose of reading is to learn. And true learning require not only reading but also re-reading, execution, and reflection on what you have read. 

You can't just read book after book and expect to learn more. Learning is not like filling an empty glass with water. 

You have to carefully choose what water you put in the cup. You have to be slow but consistent.

Practicing spaced repitation and writing the summary of the books that you have read and comprehending in your own words also helps you to learn.

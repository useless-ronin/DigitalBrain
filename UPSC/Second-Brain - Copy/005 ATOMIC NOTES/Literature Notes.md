Whenever you read, watch or listen to something create a note about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or what you can use in your own future writing.

Don’t just copy. Understand first and then write it in your own words. A literature note is your interpretation of what the author is trying to say.

In challenging cases, you may need to elaborate your notes while in some cases, just jotting down some keywords might be sufficient.

The purpose of rewriting notes is not to copy and paste the content from one place to another place. It has a deeper meaning. Writing in your own words means that you have understood what the author is trying to say. You are not copying someone else's thought and passing them as your own. The purpose is to take mental ownership and to prove to yourself that you understand what you have just read.

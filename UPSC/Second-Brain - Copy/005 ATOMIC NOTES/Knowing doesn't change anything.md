Knowing things doesn't change you. Learning is not progress. Whatever it is that is in your head is of no value if you don't use it in the real world.

WHat will knowing you need to go to the gym do if you don't do. You can go one day but that doesn't change anything either. 

You have to put in the reps in whatever you do.

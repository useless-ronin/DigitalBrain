Reading is an important skill very few practice. Reading makes you poweful. You can learn anything by reading. You should be reading a lot. But also, there's a lot of junk outside. 

Reading wrong things at the wrong things is worst. 

You have to read the basics, fundamentals and the science which most people can't disagree with. Read originals, classics and philosophers. Read mathematics, science, microeconomics and all the basic stuff. 

Read stuffs that has survived for more than 100 years. Don't read the interepretations of modern people who want to feed you and sell you stuffs.

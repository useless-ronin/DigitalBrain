What is quality content? There's no such thing as quality content. It's all subjective. Here's what you should focus and you'll be on the journey to success as content creator

- Are you proud of this piece of content?
- Does it help others in some way, whether it be educational, entertaining, or a form of escape?

Asking these questions really changed how I think about quality content. I no longer focus on making quality content. I focus on creating something that provide value.

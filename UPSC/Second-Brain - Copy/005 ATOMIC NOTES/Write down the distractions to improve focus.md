When you are doing a task, devote yourself to just doing it. Distractions will come but don't get swept away by them. You can create a distractions follow-up list to deal with this.

Every time something seeks your attention, write it down on a paper. By writing down it, you commit to it but not right now. You schedule to do it later. 

Now you can easily come back at the task you were doing without being swept away by tiny distractions.

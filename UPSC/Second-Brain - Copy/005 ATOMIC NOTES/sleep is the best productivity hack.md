Sleep is the source of all health and enery. And most of us try to avoid sleep or not sleep at all. Its a short-sighted strategy. It will not take you very long. 

If you want to play the long-game you have to put your ego and stubborness aside and priortize sleep more than anything else.

If you want to work with your minds, the better you can think and the better you mental and physical states will be, the better you will perform.

The best productivity tip is to: Go to bed early. Wake up early. Remove distractions, focus and be in control.

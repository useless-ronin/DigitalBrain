Specific knowledge is something that you were doing or interested as a kid almost effortlessly. It is something you don't even considedr a skill, but people around you notice. It is found by pursuing your innate talents, genuine curiosity and your passion. 
It can't be found by going to school or college or some kind of job.
When you do something because you are innately obssesed and naturally inclined to do it, you will be better at doing it than the rest. This will force the society to keep paying your more than anyone.

If you have specific knowledge, no one can compete with you. You can escape your competition through authenticity by simply being you.

> Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.

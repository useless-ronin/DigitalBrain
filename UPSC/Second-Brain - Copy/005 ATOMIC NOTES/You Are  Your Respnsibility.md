Did you do what you should do today? Or made excuses?

This life is 100% your responsibility. No one in the world is coming to save you. Not your parents, not your teachers, not your friends. They are all busy with their own lives. You have to stop making excuses and do what you are supposed to do.

Doctors won’t make you healthy.
Nutritionists won’t make you slim.
Teachers won’t make you smart.
Gurus won’t make you calm.
Mentors won’t make you rich.
Trainers won’t make you fit.
Ultimately, you have to take responsibility.
Save yourself. - **Naval Ravikant**

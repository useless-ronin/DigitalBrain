Money is often termed as evil in our society. But it isn't actually.  There's nothing evil about money. But lust for money is bad. The best way to avoid the lust for money is not to upgrade your lifestyle.
We see people who just with a slightest amount of gain in wealth go on to upgrade their lifestyles and end up being miserable. 

With money, what you should look first is financial freedom. If you stop yourself from upgrading your lifestyle early in your life, you might eventually end up being financially free.

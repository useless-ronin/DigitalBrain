Envy is the enemy of sucesss. But jealousy and envy are human emotions that are hard to overcome. One simple way to overcome these emotions is to realize that you can't just choose to take out the little pieces from the life of the people you are jealous of. 

Unless you want to be the same person, you can't just pray for the small aspect of his life. If you want the good physique like the other guy, you can't just chose his body. You have to do everything he does. You have to train everyday. You can't eat shit. You have to be disciplined.

You have to ask yourself this question: Do i really want to be that person with all their desires, family, routine, self-image, etc.? If the answer is no. Stop being jealous. If you are not willing to do 100% swap with the person you want to be, there's no point in  being jealous.

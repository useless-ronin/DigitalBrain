We all have limited time. You can't divide your time to many things. You can't say yes to everything that comes your way. **If you can't decide , the answer is no.** You should have a mental filter of "Hell yeah or Hell No". 

Life is full of opportunities. Some decisions are long-lived such as marrying, starting a business, etc. Therefore it is extremely imortant that you say yes to things that you are certain about only.

Someone requesting you do something is an option, not obligation. 

Know that you might die tomorrow. Do you still want to say 'Yes'.

In our day to day life, we can easily lose the track of the long term goal. It fades away from your vision. It slips away from your mind.
> Your long-term goal should be so embedded in your mind taht you never lose the sight of it.

Start with small goals that are more in line with your long term vision. They will act as a fuel for your long term vision. But when you don't get the short-term victory on your goals, we easily lose the sight of those long-term goals.

When we stop the daily tasks and diciplines that allow us to achiev our goals, a day slips by, then another and then another. A day turns into weeks, the months and then years.
And when you look back after a year, you have made no progress.
Why did this all happen? Because you lost the sight of your long-term vision.

Your first goal should be to embeed the long-term goal in your mind and burn in into your soul.

What should you do?
- Think about it
- WRite about it
- Talk about it
- Hang it up on your wall

But most important, do something about it. You should never let a day slip by without soing somthing that moves you towards your goal, however small or insignificant that step might be.

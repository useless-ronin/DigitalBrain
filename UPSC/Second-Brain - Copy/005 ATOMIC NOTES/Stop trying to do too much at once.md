----
We all have a variety of interests and passions. We want to do achieve all those things at once. We are so enthusiastic about doing those things, but our actions never meet our enthusiasm.

Trying to pursue multiple pursuits at the same time will fail you in every one of them. Instead of trying to do all of them at once, tackle them one by one.

Make small plans. Commit to an idea for at least 3 months before daydreaming about another one.
Or,
Maybe at least commit to an idea for 30 days. Commit for small bursts.  Because small plans are more likely to carry over for a long time. while multi-year plans are abandoned more.

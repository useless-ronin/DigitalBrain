Unlike the traditional retirement where you had to work for 40 years before you could finally retire, the modern retirement is different.

Modern retirement means making enough money from what you do to earn money and transitioning to doing things that you love to do, where money is secondary. 

We all start working to pay bills. But that's now how it should end. Stop falling for the traps that society has made for you. 

Money shouldn't be the end goal of your life. It should be your goals, your legacy, and people you care about.

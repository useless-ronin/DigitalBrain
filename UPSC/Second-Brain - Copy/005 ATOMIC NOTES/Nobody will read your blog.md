Not writing online because you don't have audience to start with is a bullshit execuse. You build your audience by writing good stories and sharing ideas. 

Writing is not only for the audience. Its for yourself. It brings clarity to your thoughts. 
Initially you won't have good ideas. Your writing won't be good. Maybe you'd even scare away the few people who find you. But if you stay consistent and focus on improving your writing, you will have an audience. 

To be honest, nobody will read your blog until it gets good. And to get good, it requires time and effort. 

If you never write, nobody will read your blog. If you start today, maybe within a year you will have a good audience.

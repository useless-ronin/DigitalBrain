Content republishing is the most effective strategy to grow on different platforms. But most people do it wrong. 

People are lazy and they expect to grow their audience on lazy thinking and lazy work. That will not work. 

Republishing your work will need some work to be done. You can't just copy your content and paste it for another platform. You have to make you content suitable for the platform. 

You can gain a lot of leverage if you know how to republish your content well.

The human brain wants to do what's easy and avoid something that is uncomfortable in the moment even if it needs to be done. 
Activites such as reading for exams, writing, working on a project, or cleaning the dishes gives us emotional discomfort. So, inste ad of doing the things that needs to be done, we stay on the bed and make countless scrolls on our phones.Why? 
Because that's too easy. You don't feel bored, resentment or difficulty doing so.

But it doesn't make all the obligations and responsibilites go away. It just gives you a feeling of temporary relief while compromising your future.

Inspiration hits us at different times. And that's the exact moment when you should do something about that thing. If you say you'll do it some times later, you're never gonna do it. Why? Because inspiration is perishable. The motivation you have to do things when you are inspired will not remain same forever. 

Whatever you want to do or are inspired to do. Do it. Don't wait for next time. Remember you're mortal and time is slipping by. It's hard and often challenging to do a dreadful task but start with the smallest step.

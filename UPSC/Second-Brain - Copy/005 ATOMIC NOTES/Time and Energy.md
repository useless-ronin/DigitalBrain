Time is a finite resource but energy is not. Time is constant but energy is not. Energy is a different story. you can expand your energy and even renew it.

Trying to work for longer hours doesn't account for more productivity. It rather takes a toll on or physical, mental and emotional health. 

Only if you can manage your time and energy, you will be productive. You will produce quality work. 

It feels like there is always more to do than time allows. It feels only if we knew how to master time, we'd do more.

But that's far from truth.

No matter how much time you have, if you don't manage your energy, you won't get much done.

How you invest your time is more important than how much time you have.

Scheduling every minute of your day doesn't account for your energy.

Some tasks require more energy than others. Some task can't be done while multi-tasking and lack of energy causes dip our productivity.

Energy management is the key to a productive and fulfilled work.

If you want to create a viral content, the quality should be top-notch. It should be the best article ever written on that subject. 

If all you write is a mediocre content, you will turn your audience away. 

If you give time and write one good article, it has higher chance of getting shared, republished and promoted. You also have less competition because you have already outthrown the competition by writing a high quality piece.

Creating a mediocre content is more risky than taking risk with blockbuster models.

We all have tiny moments in life. We never know when time flies by. But if you do take 5 minutes out of your day and do this reflection on your day, the quality of your life will dramatically increase.

Everyday before you go to bed, ask yourself what is the best story you can tell that happened to you today. 
Now, write small snippets or keywords that describes the story and put in a diary or a journal. 

Doing this will help you to never lose a single day in your life. If you look forward to today after 3 years, you will vividly remember what happened today. You'll be brought back right to the moment. 

Doing this every day will also help you enjoy your life, slow down, live life to have more experiences and stories to tell.

Productivity doesn't mean you need to have one system to do all things. And not one app or a system can handle all of those.

You can have multiple apps for doing different things. After all productivity is having a suite of apps, that can do the task nicely, rather than having a single source.

At first, I wanted to have a centralized hub where I could store all my notes, make to-do's and plans but unfortunately I was missing something.

Each tool has their own purpose and it is best to seperate them.

Marvin= to-do
Gcal= calendar
Obsidian= Notes
Notion= Database, Plannning and Organization
Pocket= Read later
Readwise= Syncing Highlights

Think of things as an ecosystem that works together. Each piece of software complements the other.

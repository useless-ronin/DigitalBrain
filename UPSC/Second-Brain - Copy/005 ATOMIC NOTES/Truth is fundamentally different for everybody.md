Why does a man devote his entire life to painting, while another hates it? Why does a man devote is life to climb everest, while another doesn't dare to leave his home? Why does one seek to conquer the world while the other seek to conquer himself? Why does one seek to know everything about the world but the other is content with what the worlds tell him?

The answer is truth is not so simple. It is fundamentally different for everybody. You have to find your truth.

It is available to everybody but very few reach for it. Truth is the birthright of every man but very few exercise it.

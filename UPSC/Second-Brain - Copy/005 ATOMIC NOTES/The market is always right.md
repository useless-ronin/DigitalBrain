When something doesn't go as they thought, people start blaming the market. They blame market for losing their money

Here's a simple truth about the market you need to understand:
The current price in teh market is a reflection of the beliefs of all traders who choose to act as a force on price by putting on a trade. 

You may believe something to be of the highest quality, but if the market doesn't have the same belief as you do, it doesn't matter how good your information was, the market is going to move in the direction of the strongest force. 

The market is never wrong in what it does. It just is. Every moment in the market creates an opportunity to make money.
And, after all, trading is not about being right or wrong, its about making money.

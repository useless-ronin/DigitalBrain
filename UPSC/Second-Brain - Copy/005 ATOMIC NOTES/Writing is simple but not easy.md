Writing is simple. You just have to take out your computer, find a place to sit, adopt the writers mindset and start writing. But, it's easy. 

For beginners, the hardest process is to start writing. They don't have enough motivation to start writing. 

If you are just beginning to write, the best you way to begin is to build a habit of consistently writing without ever thinking about taking a break.

Here's how you can build a good writing habit:
- Pick a same time everyday
- Set up same place for writing only 
- Set daily word requirement
- Stick to it. 

If you don't create a fixed routine, you will often feel that it's harder to build a habit.

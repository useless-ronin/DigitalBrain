Most writers don't make money. That's the truth. 
They live in an illusion that just because they wrote something, others have to read it. 
No, Nobody owes you shit.

Good writing is not just about writing. You can't write what everyone else is already writing and make yourself standout.

Nobody likes to read the same stories over and over again. 

Writing is about thinking. The better you think, the better your writing is. The grammatical errors in writing doesn't matter much, if your writing carries a strong message.

The only thing that matters is your thinking, after all writing is thoughts put on a paper.

The better and unique your thoughts are, the better will be your writing

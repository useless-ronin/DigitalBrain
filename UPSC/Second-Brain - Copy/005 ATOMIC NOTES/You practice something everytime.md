Every single moment of your life, you are practicing something. If you are not reading, you are practicising not reading. If you are not writing, you are practicising not writing. If you are not training, you are practicising not training. 

Your brain forms connections between different neurons. Every time you do something it becomes stronger. If you don't read, the connections of not reading will be stronger. If you don't exercise, the connections of not training will be stronger. 

You only have this moment and what you do at this moment will determine what you will do in the future. Whether you move towards or away from where you actually want to be.

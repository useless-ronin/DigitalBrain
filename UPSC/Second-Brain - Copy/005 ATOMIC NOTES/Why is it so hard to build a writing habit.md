Habits make our life easy. They cause a behavior to be automatic. 

Anything that is repeated enough times and rewarded becomes automatic. 

But there are certain activities that are hard to make into habits. Writing for example. Its extremely hard to train our mind to automate writing. 

Unlike meditation, reading and other activities, writing is a different when it comes to creating habit. 

Writing not only involves sitting down to write and just putting out the words. It requires complex thinking, and planning. 

You don't write the same thing again and again. So everytime you sit down to write you have to think. You are not just typing.  Everytime you are sitting down to write, you are thinking about something entirely new. 

Creating new combination of ideas. Researching about a new thing. 

Writing is not a simple activity. Its a much more complex system.


If you want to write consistently, everyday. you have to stop thinking writing as an activity. Treat it as a project that with a complex system. 

Here's a system I've designed that has helped me to go from writing 1 article a month to 25 articles a month.



# Write at the same time every day
This will create a structure in  your mind. You can't train your brain to write but you can train 

# Capture your ideas
- You might have read about how every writer on Medium is always write ideas. A lot of them even say they took the idea from James Altucher.


# Before you Turn on Your Computer Do This
- Create an outline. If you don't have an outline of your article, you are fucked. You will have to stare at the blank screen most of the time. 
- I always spend 10-15 minutes writing a outline on Microsoft word with voice typing

# Conclusion first
- Allows me to stay on track and not divert away.


# Create a rough draft
- Once you have an outline. WRite as fast as you can.

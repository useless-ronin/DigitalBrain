Motion and action seems similar but they are not. You are planning, learning and strategizing whe you are in motion. Those things are important but will never produce any result.
Action is what delivers result.
It doesn't matter how many topic ideas you have to write about or how many side hustlee, you will not create anything until you take action.

#### Why do we like to be in motion when it doesn't produce anu any result?
Because motion allows us to feel like we are making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism.
It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations wheren that migh happen. 
So, this makes us slip into motion instead of taking action. You want to delay action.

Motion is a form of procastination. It makes you feel like you are getting thing done but what you are doing is preparing to get things done.

I've spent most of my time like this. Instead of taking action and implementation, Focusing on planning and learning more than what's needed initially
Stop merely practicing and start taking action.

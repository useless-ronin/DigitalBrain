Your subconscious mind is a miracle maker. On the subconscious level it is more powerful than you can even think of. Unlike your conscious brain, the subconscious is always active. It never rests. 
If you can tap into your subconscious, you can work miracles in your life. You can't consciously control your subconscious. Here's a simple technique used by most successful people: Never sleep without a request to your subconscious. 
Just before sleep and just after sleep is when you can put something into your subconscious. Here's what you need to do:
- Direct your thoughts intentionally before you sleep
- Write the things you want to accomplish and meditate on them
- Ask questions related to them. Be more specific. Your subconscious will work when you sleep

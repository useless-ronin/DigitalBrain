Time is the most precious thing you have. It's more important that money, your friends or anything else. It is the only thing you have. You came alone and you go alone. ALl you have left in between is time. 

It is limited and if you don't use it wisely, it is wasted. You have to use your time in doing things that you love and enjoy. You have to use your time to be around people that are inspiring and good for you.

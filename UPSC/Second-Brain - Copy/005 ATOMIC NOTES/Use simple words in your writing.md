If you are writing online, this is the key principle you should never forget. You are not writing to impress someone. Your writing should be as simple as it possibly can be. Readers engage more deeply with writing that is simple. Use simple words and sentences. After all, simple writing is what's easy to understand.

If you think you will show how cool you are by showing your rich vocabulory to the audience, you are more likely to scare them off. By using fancy and intellectual words in your writing, you are making readers do the extra work. 

And esepcially if you are writing in english, you should be more careful of this. Because there are more non-native english readers out there who don't understand much of english.

You sit down to create a piece of content. You spend a lot of time and effort in it. Finally you pulish it. Nothing. You get nothing.

You publish a piece that took 10 minutes to create and it spread all over.

There's debate going over whether to focus on quality or quantity. Here's my two cents on it.

When you are publishing online, at least when you are just starting, focusing on quantity over quality is a better strategy. 

- You never know what's going to work. So more published work means more data about what works and what not.
- The more you create, the better you become. Just because you focus on quantity doesn't mean you undermine quality. You should hav a baseline standard for quality. Aiming for perfection will kill your journey. 
- Online writing is about building a content of library. The more you write, the more exponential growth you receive

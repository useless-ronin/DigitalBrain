Life is about experiencing things. But once we get used to our environment, we inhibit our ability to notice most things. Our brain doesn't like to spend energy paying attention to unimportant things. 

When something is important, it is salient. Things are salient if they trigger desire dopamine. They broadcast a message to wake up and pay attention because its important. 

When you visit a new country, or even a new place, which is radically different from where you have been from, you notice much more. It's as if you've taken a mind-altering drug. It allows you to see things that you would normally miss. You feel more alive.

Being in a new environment, there's not much to inhibit. It can cause great pleasure but also confusion and disorientation. As the new environment becomes familiar, we adjust, and eventually master it.

Therefore, the way to experience more of life and feel alive is to doing new things, exploring new places and adventuring into life.

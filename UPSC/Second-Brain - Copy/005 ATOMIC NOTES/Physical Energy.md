Physical energy is your ability to involve in physical activities and the feeling associated with it. 

If you are physically energized, you can 3X your engagement in any work you od.

# How to restore physical energy
- Prolonged sits at a single place and not moving your body will deplete your energy. **So don't sit at a place of a long time.** Take breaks and do some physical activity like walking or pushups or whatever that can pump your heart.
- Also, the quality of breaks is more important than the length for recharging.
- What you eat and how much you eat also affects your energy levels. Not all foods are equal. Make sure what you eat helps you in reaching your energy levels.

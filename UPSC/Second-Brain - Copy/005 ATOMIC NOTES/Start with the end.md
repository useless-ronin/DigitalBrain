Figure out what where you want to go and work your way backwards.  If you’re writing a movie, _solve the climax first_. If you’re opening a restaurant, begin with the experience you want the dinner to have when she walks in and enjoys a meal. Answer the question, “What is this about?”

End first, then beginning and middle. That’s your startup, that’s your plan for competing in a triathlon, that’s your ballet.

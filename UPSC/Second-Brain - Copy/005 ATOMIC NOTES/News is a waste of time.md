News is a complete waste of time. It has no relevancy to your life. 

Even if you want to be a good citizen who wants to know the stuffs of the nation, you don't have to do it daily. Once a month is okay. Annual is even better.

People argue that you should be exposed to the events happening around you. No, you don't.

News is not just a waste of time but also unhealthy. 

If your life, by any means doesn't improve with news, you can stop watching or reading the news.

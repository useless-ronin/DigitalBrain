No one is going to value your time more than you value yourself. 

Whatever you want in life, you've to make it your priority. You can't chose anything over it.

You have to attach a high hourly rate for yourself.

And before you make any decision in life, ask yourself whetere its worth throwing your hourly inspirational rate.

You have the choice to use your time to do the small stuffs or use it to do the big stuffs.

You don't have to do everything by yourself. If anything costs you less than your hourly rate, delegate it. You don't have to do something that you don't do. Outsource as much as you can.

The purpose of money is to save yourself time so that you can spend it doing what you love.

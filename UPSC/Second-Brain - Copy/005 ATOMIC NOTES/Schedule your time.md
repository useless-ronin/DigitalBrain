Time that's not scheduled gets lost. You are capable of accomplishing a lof more than you think but only if you put in the work. 

To put in the work, you need time. The more time you put, the better you become. You can't have more time, but you can make better use of existing time. 

Create blocks of 30-60 minutes and schedule every hour of your day. Batch similar task together so your mind doesn't have to spend energy switching between tasks.

Don't just schedule time for work. Schedule time for breaks, schedulte time for fun, spending time with family and friends as well.

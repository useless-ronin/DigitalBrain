If you look clearly around you, people who earn more than an average person are the ones who are living a miserable life. 

It might seem like they have a lot of money but they are infact the most poor.

People spend more than they earn. They are addicted to spending. Like everything, overspending is a lifestyle. If you don't fix it before its too late, its hard to recover from all the loss that you incur. 

Don't have [[Lifestyle Inflation]]. If you are earning more, don't spend more. Instead invest it into assets that bring you money before you spend any of that money.

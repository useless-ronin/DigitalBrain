Most people, even after making a lot money end up being poor. They let lifestyle inflation creep into their life.

Lifestyle inflation is an increase in the spending behaviour of an individual with the rise in income. 

Even after a huge rise in their income, they still live paycheck to paycheck having only enough money to pay their bills. 

This is one of the habits of people that keep them poor.

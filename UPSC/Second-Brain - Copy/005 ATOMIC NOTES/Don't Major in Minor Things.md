The life we have is not short. It is enough to make some big accomplishments but we waste most of it. We waste it doing useless things. If you want to make something out of your life you have to play long-term games with the long-term people.

If are attending the geography or the history class, and realize you are never gonna use that information for ever in your life, drop the class. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of your energy.

If you are in a relationship and don't think you can go long-term, leave it. 

99% of the things you learn in life will be wasted. They will be of no use to you. But the problem comes in finding what the 1% is. When you find your 1%, invest in it for the rest of your life, go all in and forget about the rest.

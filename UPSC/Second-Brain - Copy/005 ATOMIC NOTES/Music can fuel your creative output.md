Repeating same songs over and over and over makes them fade into themselves. 

It can fuel your creativity and put you in the zone of creative genius. Time stops. Distraction stops. You don't think about unnecessary things.

You shut ht outside world. You don't hear yourself as you are writing or even talking to yourself. You're not even aware of the noise you are making. The only thing that you have with you is what you have at your hand. The problem that you are trying to solve.

There is one simple philosophy of life that can take you from where you are to where you want to be. Here it is: "Easy choices will make life hard, hard choices will make life easy".

Remeber when you want to scroll on your phone instead of working on your project. That's an easy choice. But I doubt that will take you anywhere. But if you make a hard choice to work on your project, you will move forward.

We all are provided with different choices in life. Whenever you have two different paths of relatively equal choices, chose the harder one that is more painful in the short-term. 

If you make an easy choice to avoid the short-term pain, you trade off your future for the comfort. 

Whenever you are decide to do things of higher nature, you will feeel discomfort. But if you see in the long run, that decision is what will help you build your future.

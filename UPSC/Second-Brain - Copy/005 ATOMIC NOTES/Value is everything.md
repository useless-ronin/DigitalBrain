If you want  to make it big online, you have to provide value. Value derives everything, money, fame, attention everything. 
You don't have to be selling something constantly. You just give value and people will come back to you more. 

You can produce top-notch content which doesn't provide value or you can create as much content as you can without comprimising the quality, the former will win. 

The more content you make, the more you can sell your old stuffs, the more you can redirect other people to your old stuffs.

Remember that the best salespeople aren't really good at selling at all. They do what they do the best and people seek them out for more.

If you provide value, people will be automatically drawn to you.

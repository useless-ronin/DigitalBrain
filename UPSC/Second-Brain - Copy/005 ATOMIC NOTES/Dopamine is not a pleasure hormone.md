Dopamine was initially discovered as a pleasure molecule. But it isn't about pleasure a t all. With only 0.0005% brain cells producing dopamine, its able to exert a much influential feeling. 

The answer to this is found in the monkey and a light bulb experiment done by Wolfram Schultz. He implanted electrodes on the brain of monkeys and placed them in a box that had two light bulbs and box. Every once in a while the light bulb would turn on. One light bulb suggested that the food was on the right box and another signaled the food was on the left box.

It took sometime for the monkey to figure out the pattern. At first, they randomly opened the boxes and got it right half of the time. And when the found the food in the box, the dopamine circuits fired in their brain.

After they figured out the rule, something strange happened. They reached for the correct food containing box everytime. And the timing of dopamine release shifted from firing at the discovery of food to firing at the light.

For the monkeys, seeing the food was unexpected at first. But as they figured out the rule, seeing the light go on was unexpected. The surprise they fell came from the light instead of food.

This experiment lead to the arousal of new hypothesis: Dopamine is not the pleasure hormone. It is a reaction to the unexpected- the possibility and anticipation.

Dopamine is triggered by the thrill of something unexpected and adventerous. This is the reason why gambling is so addictive. The rewards are so unpredictable. 

Dopamine is the reason why millions of people spend money on lottery tickets even when the chances of them getting hit by lightning is more than them winning lottery.

The permanent note is the soul of the Zettelkasten system. All the fleeting notes and literature notes are only meant to help you write permanent notes. The permanent note is what adds real value to your system.

It will never be thrown away and contains all the necessary information in itself. They are always stored in the same way in the same place. Every permanent note holds a single idea and is elaborated enough to have the potential to become a part of or inspire a final written piece.

Literature notes were your interpretations of the author's thoughts. They are written in the context of the source they are inspired from. Permanent notes, however are written in the context of your own ideas and thoughts. They are written to link these interpretations with what you already have.

When creating permanent notes, you don’t just copy the author’s thoughts. You think for yourself; how you can relate an idea with what is relevant for your research.

The main idea of the Zettelkasten system is not to collect notes but to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions.

Passion, purpose and these stuffs seems like some hi-fi words people use. People are often time confused with all these words floating around their heads.  Here's a simpler question you can ask yourself.  **"What is the one thing that feels like play to me but work to others"**

Life is all about doing what you love. Ask yourself this question. When you find something that you really enjoy and like, it will feel like a play to you. But to others, it will feel like work because they don't love that thing. 

When you love something, you are genuinely interested and curious about that thing. This will also help you to escape the competition.

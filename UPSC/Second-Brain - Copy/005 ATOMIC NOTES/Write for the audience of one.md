The only person you need to worry about when writing is yourself. Do what gives you life and stop living up to the expectations of other people. 

Don't write for others and for the sake of getting approval. If you do, you will get trapped. 

When you write for yourself, you attract an audience of like-minded people. Even if you are 1 in a million, you will still find 7 thousand people in the world who resonates with you.

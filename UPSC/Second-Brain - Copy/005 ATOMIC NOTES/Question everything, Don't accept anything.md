One thing that seperates humans from any other being on the planet is our ability to ask questions. 

If you don't question what you do every single day, you can't be any better than the 90% people.

If you don't understand something, dig in until you find the reason. Question yourself

Question everything, Don't accept anything without finding answer.

All of us can be better, all of us can do better, if only we start asking the right questions, hard questions.

Time management would work great for machines. But for humans, I doubt it.

We want to make efficient use of every moment. But it is not how we are built to function as human beings.

Most people still turn back to the industrial indicator of productivity.

Working for 8 hours straight might work to impress others but it doesn't lead to increase in the output. 

It contradicts the science of performance.

We, as humans are not built to work for such long hours. If you don't rest and recover, the quality of your work seriously suffers.

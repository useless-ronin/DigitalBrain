Most of us live life on auto-pilot. We do the same things that we did yesterday. We don't change. We are scared to try out new things. But life is all about trying new things, Experimentation.

If we live as we are told to do, we'll never discover ourself. We will remain caged by our comfort zone. 

Everything in our life is an experiment. And learning to experiment is like working on your mental muscle. The more you experiment, the better you get at it.

Yes, its scary because your experiments may fail, but all one person needs is one experiment to blow up.

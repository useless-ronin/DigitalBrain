Remember the old saying, "There's no such thing as writing, only rewriting."

Whatever it is you are doing, get the idea on paper. Ge the first full draft as soon as possible. Create momentum and  write your draft as if someone is chasing you with gun. 

If you stop, you are caught and then dead. Don't think or look back. Don't stop to correct the spellings. Check off the 'Grammarly' extension. 


Don't worry about the quality of your draft. Nobody will see your first draft. It doesn't matter how flawed or imperfect your draft is. Don't judge.

It will be refined anyways.

Most of the bad decisions in our life we take are as a result of our feelings rather than our rational thinking. If you want to be absolutely good at what you do, you have to have control over your mind. You just have to assert it. You have to be in the control. You have to do what you are going to do. 
Impose what you want to get done on brain and move your life where you want to. Don't ever let your mind and feelings control you.

When you don't like the feeling of doing the extra rep, do it anyway. When you feeling like quitting, just go for another round. This is how you make yourself stronger physically, mentally and spritually. By imposing your intents to your brain.

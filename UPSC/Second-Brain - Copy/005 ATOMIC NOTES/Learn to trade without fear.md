Perceiving trading opportunities is an easy part. Execution is the hard part. 

Your ability to execute trades is a function of the amount of fear you generate or the lack of it. Many traders see opportunities but can't execute their trades properly. Because they have not yet released themselves from fear and painful experiences of losing money

Fear narrows your focus of attention. It is a natural reaction to threats and dangers. But you can't make money trading with fear.  You'll  reject any information that might seem threatening to what you believe.

You have to learn to trade without fear. You have to completely trust yourself and act according to the information the market offers you without blocking any information.

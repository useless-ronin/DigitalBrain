If you want to connect with your audience, you have to stop pretending to be a robot. Stop showing yoursel as a pitch perfect. 

Don't sound to be somebody you're not. Guess what? Your audience can smell it.

Show your vulnerabilities. Be authentic and share your stories that are real and you will develop a deeper relationship with your audience.

No matter how much time you have, if you don't have energy, its useless.

Imagine the last time you were sick. What was it like? Was it even hard to get out of bed? 

In that situation, even though you have time, you can do nothing. Because You have no energy.

You are physically and mentally exhausted in fighting the sickness.

So time without energy is useless. You can only maximize the value of your time when you learn how to manage your energy levels.

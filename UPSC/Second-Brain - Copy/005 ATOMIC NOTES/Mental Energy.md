Your brain is the most important part of your body. If your are not mentally energized, it almost becomes impossible to complete the task.

## How to restore mental energy
- Our brain is the most complex system. We can't multi-task and at the same time produce quality work.
- Distractions are costly. If you want to produce the best work, you have to shut off all  the distractions and only focus on the task at hand. Temporary shift in attention can take up to 25% more time to finish the task.
- You have to reach 'Flow State'. 
- But your mind can't be always in the focused state. Take breaks and let it wander. 
- Take deep breaths

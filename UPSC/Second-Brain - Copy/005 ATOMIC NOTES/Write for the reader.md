You won't be a successful writer by being selfish. Your work should help the reader gain something. If you only boast about yourself and write about your experiences without any takeaway for the reader, you will not make it as a writer. 

Why would a reader want to read your writing if there's nothing in it for him. You should educate, inspire or entertain the reader through your writing. 

Writing solely for the purpose of pleasure is OK but not OK if you want to make a career as a writer.

Nobody cares about you. You should connect your writing with the reader's mind. 

There should be a balance between what you want to write about and what your audience wants to read about.

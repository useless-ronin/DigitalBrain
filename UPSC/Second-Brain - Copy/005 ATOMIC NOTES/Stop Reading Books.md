I know, this might sound paradoxical but yes you have to stop binge-reading books.

The purpose of reading is to change your thoughts, and your life. If you choose the dopamine hits of reading one book after another, instead of actually executing the ideas in real life, you're doing more wrong that right.

Strategize your reading. Read, re-read and summarize. Understand the text and execute the ideas to make the best out of that book.

Mornings are the sacred time. You should protect your mornings like a cat protect its kitten. No phone, no e-mail or social media. 

Morning is the time when you are at your peak and perfrom best. Morning hours will either make you or break you.

Be clear on your priorities. Just because someone is working out in the morning doesn't mean you will have to. Just because someone wakes up at 5 and meditates for 2 hours doesn't mean you will have to. 

Here's my morning ritual:
- Prepare for the day before night
- Stretch in bed for 5 minutes
- Express gratitude, meditate on my goal
- Visualize my day
- Start Writing articles for 2 hours straight

Your work should be around the time when you perform the best not around the social norms and expectations.

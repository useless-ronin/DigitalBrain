Sleep is important for your immune system. If you don't sleep well and receive quality sleep, you lower down your immune system. 

Imagine the day when you have been caught with flu. You just want curl up in the bed and sleep. And that's exactly what you should do. There is a bidirectional relationship between sleep and your immune system.
In a conducted research, the infection rate in people who slept only 5 hours was 50% as compared to the 18% rate in people who slept 7-8 hours.

A study demonstrated that a single night four hour sleep such as going to bed at 3 a.m and waking up at seven a.m. swept away 70% of the natural killer cells circulating in the body, relative to a full eight-hour night of sleep.

A study of 25,000 individuals showed 40% increased risk of developing cancer in those who slept 6 hours or less compared to those sleeping seven hours a night or more.

If you want a different life than the one that you are having right now, you have to change the way you do different things. 


Life is like cooking. If you don't know the best ingredients, no matter how good of a cook you are, you'll not make the best food.

Your input decides your output. 

You have to make sure that what you put in your mind, body, work and relationship is a quality ingredient.

Its this simpe: If you want to change your output, you have to change the input. You have to replace the depleting ingredient with better ones.

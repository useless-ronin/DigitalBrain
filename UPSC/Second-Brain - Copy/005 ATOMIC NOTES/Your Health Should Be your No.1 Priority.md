# Your health should be your no.1 Priority 
Your physical, mental and spiritual well-being should be your first priority. You should be physically active. We are not meant have clothes that keep us warm all the time. We're meant to have some cold exposure. It boosts your immune system.

Ditch the extremists and any food invented in the last few hundred years.
If you are making the hard choices right now in what to eat, you’re not eating all the junk food you want, and making the hard choice to work out, then your long-term life wil be easy. 


You won't be sick. You will be healthy.

World’s simplest diet: The more processed the food, the less one should consume. The harder the workout, the easier the day.

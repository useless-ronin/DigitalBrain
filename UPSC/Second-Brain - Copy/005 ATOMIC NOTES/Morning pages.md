It can be quite hard to get a good grip of meditations. But free writing, its easy. Anyone can do it.

All you have to do is add a word limit and keep writing until you finish it. Don't pay attention to anything. Just write down your thougths. Don't stop, not even for a second. Just keep your words flwoignflowing. 

The correctness doesn't mater. What's even better? don't writing looking at  your screen. Type looking at your ekyboard

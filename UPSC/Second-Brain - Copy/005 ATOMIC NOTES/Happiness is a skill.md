There's a misconception among people that money will buy happiness. But if you can't be happy when you don't have money, you certainly will have hard time being happy even when you have money. Just like eating clean, exercising, reading and writing, happiness is also a skill. You have to develop this skill. The reason so many rich people are unhappy in life is because they don't have this particular skill.



Here are few questions you should ask yourself: Will your habits increase your long-term happiness rather than short-term happiness. Are you surrounding yourself with people who are generally positive and happy? Do you admire and respect the people you are surrounded with and not envy them.

It might be politically incorrect to say that you should choose your friends wisely. But you should not chosse them haphazardly based on who you live next to or who you happen to work with. You have to choose people who are happy and optimistic.

Our enemy is not the lack of preparation or the difficulty of the project, our enemy is the resistance. If you give your brain time to think, it will start producing excuses, justification, and a million reasons why you can’t/ shouldn't/ won’t do what you need to know.

Good things only happen to people who begin before they are ready. Because guess what? You are never ready. Its scary to start from a place and venture into an unknown place.  Therefore, whatever you are supposed to do, start before you are ready.

Don't wait for something to happen. If you have ideas, execute on them. Don't be a person who is in love with the idea of being big without doing something useful. An idea is worth nothing if not bought to life. 

Don't overthink. Don’t overprepare. Don’t spend all of your time planning on how you will finish the work. Don’t work on getting out every detail. Just outline it. On instinct.

> We have to work not prepare for work.

Only when you begin, life gives you more opportunities.

> **Reminder:** There are people worse than you at everything, getting paid way more than you because they didn't wait till they were "ready"

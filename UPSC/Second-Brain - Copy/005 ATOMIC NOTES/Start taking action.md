You only move or grow when you take action. Thinking or worrying about a situation or a plan will not do anything. 

By taking action, you take control of your life rather than simple letting your life control you. When you take action, it might be hard at first. But as you move, change slowly becomes easier. You also start feeling good.

Stop holding on to your plans longer than you should. The fear of taking action is more fierce than the situation that's outside.

Most people who took action early realize that the sooner they had take it, the sooner they'd change.

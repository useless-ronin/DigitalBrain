Happiness is a skill. And like any other skill, it can be practiced. Most of us attach different conditions for happiness. We want to fell happy only as long as certain conditions, like success or money are met. 

But happiness never waits for you on the other side of your desire. It's always there awaiting for you right there. We all have different desires and expectations, which are the biggest threat to happiness. 

If you want to be happy, you have to priortize happiness above all. There's no other substitute.

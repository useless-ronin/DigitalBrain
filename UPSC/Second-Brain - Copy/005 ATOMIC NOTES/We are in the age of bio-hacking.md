Technology has become a inseperable part of our life. It is impossible to imagine a life without technology. 

But what very few people understand is that: Technology is not here to help you. 

If you don't have a purpose in life, If you don't know what you want to do in your life, chances are that the technology will shape your life. 

Every big company in the world is trying to hack you. No, no not your smartphones or computer. They're in a race to hack your brian. 

You have to run faster than technology. Know yourself before the technology and algorithms know you.

Dopamine cares about getting things not enjoying them. It will make you want a house. If you have a house, it makes you want a castle. Dopamine only asks for 'more'.

When we are enjoying something, the dopamine gets suppressed. The H&N(here & now) systems are activated. The H&Ns helps us experience reality while dopamine floats above it. 

Dopamine circuits evolved to promote behaviours that lead to our survival and reproduction. We want to be rational in our decisions but our brains don't like it that way. 

Dopamine circuits activates when you see donut on the table even if you are not hungry. Not because by need, rahter by the presence of something attractive from evolutionary point of view. Because its focused on acquiring more of everything. 

Under the influence of dopamine, your brain says.,"Eat that donut even if you're not hungry. It will increase your chances of staying alive in the future. We don't know whent the food will be available in the future?"

Now, you and I know how irrational this statement sounds but our brains like it that way. Our brains have a hard wired information that our ancestors died because of starvation. So it doesn't want us to die. And after all, the end goal of an organism is to survive. 

Dopamine circuits evolved to promote behaviors that lead to survival and reproduction. It encourages us to maximize our resources by rewarding us when we do something to make our future safe and secure. 

But the hard wiring we have inside our brain don't help us in the modern world.

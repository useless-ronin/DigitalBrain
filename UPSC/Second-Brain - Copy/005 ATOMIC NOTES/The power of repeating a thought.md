Thoughts are powerful. Thoughts are the seeds of reality. They can create magic in your life. But the problem occurs when your thoughts are vauge, when your thoughts are different. 

Have one thought and repeat it over and over and over until it is in your head more than it is not. 

The more you think, the more you feel it. Your memory becomes stronger. Your perspective starts shifting. You start seeing the world differently. 

Practice one thought until it becomes the primary loop. Just pick one thought and repeat it fiercely. Commit to yourself.

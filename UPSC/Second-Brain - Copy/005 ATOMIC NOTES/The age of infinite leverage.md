We're living at the age of infinite leverage. Our efforts, skils and judgement can be multiplied 10x, 100x, 100x, or even more. No one in the history had this opportunity to leverage themselves.

Unlike traditional leverage through labour and capital, technology sits in our lap. All you need is a computer and internet and you are set.

Being permissionless and the ability to scale at large levels, technology has helped millions of people.

Your judgement is more important than how hard you work. 

If you leverage your work, you can outwork the non-leveraged worker by 1000 folds.

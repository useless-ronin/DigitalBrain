Distractions are not the problem why you are not being able to focus. They will be there any way.  Distractions are not you enemy. You have to change your mindset about distractions.

90% of the time, you choose to be distracted subconsciously. The power lies within you whether you want to get distracted or not. 

It's easy to get distracted when you have  not fully committed yourself to doing the task at hand. 

To avoid distractions, commit yourselt to something both physically, mentally and emotionally.

Every time you see a distraction, your mind will automatically revert back to doing the task you are commited to. And each distraction will also act as force to strengthen your focus.

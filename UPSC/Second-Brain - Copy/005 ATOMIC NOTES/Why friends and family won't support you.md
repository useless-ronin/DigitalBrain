When you want to change you will face a lot of resistance from your friends, family and loved ones. Its not that they don't want to see you progress. 

The human mind hates change. Unlike you most people are not willing to change. They are invested in keeping us as we are so that they don't have to deal with the change.

Therefore, it is often said that you growth never happens in old circle.

If you want to change or do something new, you have to prepare yourself to make new friends.

If you are not full of energy, the quality of your work will suffer. Energy is life. Without energy, you walk around dead, waiting for your funeral.

“Every one of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors has an energy consequence. The ultimate measure of our lives is not how much time we spend on the planet, but rather how much energy we invest in the time that we have.”

Time is a finite resource while energy is renewable.

Only when you have energy, you are able to produce your work without being exhausted.

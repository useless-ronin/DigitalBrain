In the past it made sense to follow old people. They had more experience than the new ones. They had lived life. But not anymore.

listening to old people isn't relevant anymore. Wanna know why?

The world is moving fast with technology. To keep with the world, we need to change. 

But most old people don't change. They hold to their outdated beliefs. And its not their fault either. That's how human brain is wired. It hates change.

The adults don't understand the modern world. With the speed its moving forward, they can't see what's happening.

Reading is what makes your powerful. There's nothing that's not written somewhere in the book. The solution to every problem that humanity has faced is written down somewhere in the book.

There are so many books written. You can't read all of them. You have to pick a lot of books and only get through what feels like a worthwhile piece. 

Read anything you can. You can not just read the stuff that the society tells you is good. You have to read for your own sake. 

You have to develop a love for reading. If you can do this, you can learn almost anything.


“As long as I have a book in my hand, I don’t feel like I’m wasting time.”- Charlie Munger

If you don't value your time, no one else is going to. 

Set an aspirational hourly rate. Before you make any decision to invest your time into something, ask yourself, is it worth the money that you'll be throwing away. 

Say 'No' to almost everything that comes your way. Don't waste your time in doing the small stuff. Use it do the big, important stuffs. 

Don't be busy, be focused. 
Don't act on auto-pilot. Think before you do. 

Treat yourself as if you were the most expensive person in the world. If you don't treat yourself the way you want others to treat you, how will the others treat you any better. 

Be conscious of your decision. Factor your time value in every decision you make.

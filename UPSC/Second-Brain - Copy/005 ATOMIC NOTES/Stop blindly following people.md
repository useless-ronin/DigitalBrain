You've to stop listening to a person who tells a thousand different people to do the same. If you want to do something new or big, you have to be an innovator and prescriptions don't work for an innovator.

You can't make millions by reading a book on wealth or attending a course by some guru. 

You might learn a lot about finance by reading book but manifesting millions still takes a lot of work. 

You have to stop consuming content to change your mind or position in life. Consume content only if it is needed for your own work. Don't do it unnecessarily.

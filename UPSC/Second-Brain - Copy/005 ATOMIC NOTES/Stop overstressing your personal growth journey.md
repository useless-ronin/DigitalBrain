The skill of personal growth doesn't work like the skills of sports like basketball, football.

In sports, the better you get, the more effort you need to put to get better. But, the personal growth is like skiing downhill. 

Once you start and are fairly good at it,  you'll catch the speed without effort. The singlemost effective thing you can do to gain speed is 'to do nothing'.

You have to stop putting in conscious effort at some point. 

For example, with habits, You put a lot effort to integrate them into your life at first.  But later, you do it effortlessly without even thinking about it.

Once you are downhill, stop struggling to get going. Do nothing, and you'll go at full speed.

When you were walking down the jungle with your friend at during the rock ages, everytime you hear of some noises from the bush, you had to be careful and look after.
And 9/10 times, it was nothing, just a rabbit or some insects. But at the 10th time, it may be a tiger.
The person who was optimist gets finds rabbits 9/10 times and gets eaten at the 10th time. But the pessimist friend of yours will survive every time.

Pessimism was rewarded in our evolved nature. But now we live in a much safer time. So, we have to find ways past that.

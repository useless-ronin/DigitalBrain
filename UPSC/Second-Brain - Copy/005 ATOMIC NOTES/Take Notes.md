How many times have you lost your ideas, or valuable advice or some memorable quotes. I guess you don't even have a count of it. A proper note taking system helps you to solve this problem.

The ink preserves what our memory fogets. They get more valuable as you find ideas to mix them with other notes

Knowledge comes from everywhere and if you don't quicky grab it, it will be lost. If you want to take advantage from the knowledge that's available out there without having to put pressure in your brain everytime you think about it, you have to build a note-taking system.

Building a proper note-taking system can not only help you keep all your ideas, it will also act as an extended brain 'aka' second brain.

You shouldn't save everything that you encounter in life. Only save that's important, useful, inspiring, easily lost or personal information that you want to remember. 

> As a rule of thumb, Only save 5% of what you consume.

Note-taking will be a slow consumption process. You will have to think and its not easy. It will demand time and energy. But what's the use of reading at a lightning speed if you can't remember or use any of it in future

----
The life of an artist is not easy. An artist can't live the life that everyone is living. He can't chose all the things. There are 3 parts of which he can only chose two: work, life, and fun.

He can only have two. If he tries to have all of the 3, he will have nothing at the end.

If you want your family, you will have to make tradeoffs with friends, nightouts, partying and having late night funs. 

Trying to have it all will make you a burn out mess.

You have to be willing and able to say no to one of these threee things. Not just to big things but also to the small things.  If you choose work and family, you have to say no to dinnders, hangouts, coffee times and all other stuffs. 

You have to pick the two and move on.

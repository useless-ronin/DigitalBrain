Every action you do comes with a cost. If you are investing your time wisely, you will get the compounding results. 

Procrastination is wasting all the time that you are give to you. Instead of doing what you need to do, you engage yourself with distractions. Imaine how much your life would be worth if you had invested all the time instead of wasting it. 

People don't regret the things they have done. They regret the things that they don't do when it was right time.

You can change right now. Instea of asking yourself how can I stop procrastinating, you should ask yourself what is the right thing to now and do it.

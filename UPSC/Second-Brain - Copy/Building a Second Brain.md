### Building a Second Brain: Book Summary

  
Building a second brain is about optimizing a system outside yourself. It leaves you free to roam, wander, spend less time stressing about remembering the information and spend more time doing what makes you feel alive.

We are living in the age of abundance. We have more of everything. And that's true for information as well. We consume more than ever. But have we got any results from so much consumption of information? Do we even remember any of it? Even though our brain is not made for remembering information, has the information that we consume helped us move forward in our careers and life?

This is what your second brain is for. To make better use of the information we collect, we need to package it up and save it externally. Personal knowledge management helps to harness the potential of what we know.

#### Uses of a second brain system

-   Find anything you’ve learned in the past
-   Organize your knowledge and use it to move forward in your life
-   Connect ideas 
-   A reliable system to share your work and work confidently
-   Spend less time looking for things, and more time doing the best, creative work you are capable of.

### What is second brain?

> Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. — David Allen

Your professional, as well as personal success, depends on your ability to manage and use information effectively. Information is the foundational block of everything you do.

Information overload can make us exhausted and constantly forget what we know. Using our brains to store everything we know is not a good strategy anymore. We can outsource that to technology.

The time you spend recalling and remembering information is the time that could be used to do something, invent new things, create stories, collaborate with others, and many more works.

We need to form a new relationship with technology, information, and ourselves.

Your second brain is a mirror, teaching you ayourself, and reflecting back on ideas worth keeping and acting on.

#### Rethinking Note-taking

The main aim of a knowledge worker is not to hoard information, but to produce something out of that information, to put use to it. Information is a building block and can be used to create something much greater.

Technology not just makes note-taking efficient, it transforms the very nature of notes. Just like others, you are on your phone most of the time. But instead of killing time, you are creating value.

> So many of us share the feeling we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom.

#### Choosing a Nsoftwareg app

There are many softwares that can act as your second brain. From simple word processors to more advanced tools like roam, and obsidian. Whatever you choose, your notes app is uniquely designed to facilitate personal knowledge management.

Don’t look for a perfect app before you start taking notes. Rather than having a single app that can do everything, **it's about creating a note-taking system with different apps and services**.

### The CODE Method

-   Capture: Keep what resonates
-   Organize: Save for accountability
-   Distill: Find the Essence
-   Express: Show your work

### Capture — Keep What Resonates

Information is the food for your brain. You are what you consume. A garden is only as good as its seeds. And information is the seed for your brain. You should fill your garden with the seeds of the most interesting, insightful, valuable ideas.

Knowledge is not something you go and find, it's everywhere. External knowledge fills your inner thoughts, External knowledge could include highlights, quotes, meeting notes, highlights, passages from books, stories, insights, reflections, and many more. 

#### How to avoid keeping too much(or too little)

Don’t save the whole article. Don’t just save the link for reading later as well. Understand that in a piece of content, certain parts are more interesting, helpful, or valuable to you.

You have to be a curator. Take charge of your information instead of just letting it wash over you.

**Criteria for finding valuable information:**

-   Does it inspire you?
-   See your feelings. See what sparks your imagination.
-   Is it helpful?
-   Is it personal?
-   Is it surprising?

**_Keep what resonates:_**

Don’t make it hard to decide whether to keep something or not. It will just add more resistance to the note-taking process. After all, **the secret to building any habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable.**

**How to capture information to save any content you want:**

-   Passages from book ideas
-   Using readwise and highlighting feature
-   Ideas from online articles or web pages
-   Using eloquent chrome extension
-   Ideas from podcasts
-   Bookmark the clips or segments as you are listening to them. Some apps even allow you to export the annotation
-   Ideas and thoughts in your brain
-   Using your phone to record
-   Just a voice recorder or other dedicated app such as otter which transcribes your notes
-   Ideas from youtube videos
-   Copy and paste the excerpts from the transcript part

Externalizing information can help in:

-   Remembering
-   Creating new connections between different ideas
-   Rehearsing ideas
-   Writing and thinking and interconnected. One sharpens the other
-   Free up your mental space

Try to make note-taking effortless. Conserve time and energy for later steps.

### Organize- Save for accountability

Your second brain is not just a tool, it's an environment for thinking. You can’t keep it messy. Organizing helps to shape your thinking. Most people save notes under a particular tag which becomes far too broad to be useful. Hoarding the information under one particular tag doesn’t make it much useful.

#### Organizing for action

When you know that any idea you encounter can be used, **you start paying attention to what you consume**. The action-based approach for organizing your second brain is called **PARA**. Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives.

#### How PARA works

-   **Projects:** What are you working on Right Now? Projects have a beginning and end. They are discrete chunks of work. _Examples_: Complete web design, Finish a particular course. Publish a blog post, write a book, etc.
-   **Areas:** What are you committed to over time. Areas have no definite end date. They can be lifelong projects. _Examples:_ Friends, Finances, Health, Personal development, Cooking, Marketing, Sales, etc.
-   **Resources:** Things that you want to reference in the future. Information that doesn’t belong to any project or area. _Examples_: Topics you are interested in, subjects you are researching, hobbies and passions, etc.
-   **Archives:** Things you’ve completed or put on hold. Items from the previous three categories are no longer active. _Examples_: Completed or canceled projects, areas that you are no longer committed to, resources that are no longer relevant.

#### How to decide where to put your notes

Don’t try to decide where a particular note belongs when you first capture it. Separate your capturing and organizing steps into two distinctive parts. 

Ask yourself the question: In which project will this be most useful? If none, choose the area. If no area is suitable, choose a resource and finally move it to the archive.

> You put the note in a place where it will be useful the soonest.

PARA is not a filing or storing system. **It’s a production system.** It's dynamic. We are not fixed or static to a particular organizing system. _PARA is a way of identifying what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go._

### Distill- Find the essence

Reading and research gather building blocks from our which makes the final product more impactful. We can use our notes to drill the essence and make up our source material.

Notes are things to use not just to collect. Note-taking is like time travel where you are sending knowledge through time to your future self.

#### Progressive Summarization

> Your notes are only as useful as their discoverability. 

The progressive summarization technique helps in increasing the usefulness of notes. It is a technique to highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on adding multiple layers of notes. This distills the essence of a note. 

Progressive summarization helps you navigate faster between your notes because you don’t have to spend the whole 10 minutes reading the article to get the gist. 

You can get the gist in a few seconds. **If you feel the need to know more, you can always go back to the other layers of progressive summarization and the source ultimately.**

> Progressive summarization is not a method for remembering as much as possible- it is a method for forgetting as much as possible.

It is meant for one purpose: **To make it easy to find and work with your notes in the future**.

Mistakes Novice Notetakers Make

-   **Over-highlighting:** Less is more. If you’re capturing everything, you might as well capture nothing. As a rule of thumb, each layer should contain only 10–20% of the previous layer
-   **Highlighting without a purpose in mind**: Distillation requires time and effort. You should only do it with a purpose in mind. Maybe when you’re getting ready to create something.
-   **Making highlighting difficult:** Don’t worry too much bout analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing whether to highlight something or not. Rely on your intuition. Don’t make it taxing that it breaks your flow of concentration

### Express- Show your work

Expressing is about sharing your ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks.

We all stand on the shoulder of giants. It's smart to build on thinking others have already done rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead of starting from scratch, you can start from the abundance of notes you have.

#### Everything is a remix

Nothing gets created out of thin air. We all stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before us. Borrow parts of others' work instead of taking their whole work.

#### You only know what you make

To know something means to put it into action. An idea sticks only when you engage with it. Your life will change when you begin to express your ideas and turn your knowledge into action. 

> One simple idea can change people’s lives when you share it.

#### Three stags to bring creative work together

-   **The archipelago of ideas**: They are your stepping stones. You gather a group of ideas that forms the backbone of your work. And then you switch to convergence mode to link the ideas together so that they make sense.
-   **Creating a digital outline:** A rough outline of the final product can offer far more advantages. This helps you to have something to start with instead of facing the blank screen when starting with. 
-   **The Hemingway bridge:** Hemingway would always end his writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. He built a bridge for the next day. He used today’s momentum to fuel tomorrow’s work. Whenever you are working, don’t work till the last drop of your energy. _Reserve the last few minutes and set intentions for what you would like to do in the next session or what will be your next steps_. 
-   **Dial down the scope:** Waiting until everything is ready is like sitting in a car in a driveway and waiting for all the traffic lights in the town to go green at the same time. You should drop, reduce and postpone the least important parts and move forward. Build it in a smaller version which would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time.

#### Inner Discipline and Outer Discipline

It's important to have inner discipline but it's not enough. We need an outer system that can add structure to our life. 

-   Project checklist
-   Weekly and monthly reviews
-   Noticing habits

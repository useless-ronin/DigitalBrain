# Create a Schedule that you can stick to every single day
- [[No schedule= No career]]
# Don't edit on the same day(or at least the same time)
- Task switching drains your energy
# Study only from the best sources
- Stay away from algorithms.
# Write 10 headlines every day
# Always start with a headline and dot points
- Start your car with a full tank not empty tank
# Always keep headlines on the screen when you write
- This helps your writing to be on point and not drift away
# Keep distractions away
- Keep your phone away. Use noise-cancelling headphones. Be in silence to let yourself get into the flow state

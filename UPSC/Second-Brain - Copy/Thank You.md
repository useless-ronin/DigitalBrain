Thank you for downloading the obsidian starter vault.

***Special thanks*** if you supported my work by paying for the vault.

# Getting Started
This is the exact copy of my second brain vault(some private notes are excluded.) It's not a perfect but if you are new, it will give you perspective on how you can start building your own system. 

It contains most of notes from books, articles as well as videos and online courses. You can play around them and see how you can create a note-taking system easily.

Building a second brain helps you to easily and efficiently retrieve information. You don't have to worry about forgetting things ever. Not only that you can leverage your notes and second brain to improve your life and bring real results in the your life. 

**Note:** This vault is a slight mixture of second brain system and atomic notes(from [[How to Take Smart Notes]]) as I switched to second brain from practicing [[Zettelkasten System]] for almost 2 years.

If you are new to this whole second brain thing, you can check out the book by Tiago Forte called [[Building a Second Brain]]. It will give you a perspective on how to build a note-taking system.

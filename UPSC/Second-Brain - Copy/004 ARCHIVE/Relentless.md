# What does being relentless mean?
The world is full of incredibly talented people who are not successful because they believe talent is enough. But it isn't . You need to be relentless to be great.
But what does being relentless means actually?
Being relentless means that you demand more of yourself than anyone ever could demand of you. Its about having an instinct. Instinct that says, "More" when your mind thinks "Done".

Its about achieving the impossible. Being completely instinctive and knowing what to do without thinking about it.

It's about never being satisfied, always driving to be the best and then getting even better. 
# Don't Think

If you have to do something by thinking, you are not even good at it. To be the best at what you do means that you act by instincts. Instincts that tells you to do more even when your brain tells to 'stop'.

You have to shut out all the external noises and trust your natural ability. Don't think.

Being the best not only means you have to get to the top. You have to remain there. There is always someone trying to catch up. Being the best means you have to keep going. You can't stop until you get what you want.

Everything that you need to be great is already inside of you. Waiting for you to let go. If you don't make the choices, they are gonna be made for you.

Decide. commit. Act. Succeed and Repeat.

You have to do something instead of thinking. Don't think about what others will think. Ignore the pressure to please everyone. Do whatever it takes to get where you want to be.

Your strategy is to make everyone else get to your level. You're not going down to theirs.

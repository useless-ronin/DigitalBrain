> You have to sync your mindset with the market.


Wealthy traders don't win every single time. They lose more than they gain. 
# They are impatient with their losing trades and patient with winning trades
People are mainly impatient while gaining profits while they get patient when they are losing money. They think the price will rebounce back soon. But often it doesn't happen.
Wealthy traders immediately exit their trades if the market is going against them.


# Making money is more important than being right
It is human tendency to want to be right all the time. But that mindset is not going to help you all the time in stock market.
The market can stay wrong more than you can stay solvent. It will slap you in the face every time.
If market shows you that you are wrong, immediately take action. Don't just hold on to your opinions.

> Wealthy traders do what the market tells them to do. You can't tell the market what to do.

# They view charts as people
Everyone is using technical analysis, different types of indicators that tells them something is going to happen.
Wealthy traders don't see any indicators as any buy or sell signals.
> They see people waiting to buy or sell at those lines or zones.

They see charts in terms of where traders are lining up to take action.

# They know the exit point before entering the trade
Whether they win or lose a trade, they already have an exit point figured out. 
Never get into a trade unless you know where you want to get out of trade.

# They approach trade no. 5 with the same mindset they did on the previous 4 losing trades
There are times when you will lose trades on streak. This will break your confidence. You think you are reading the market wrong and often what happens is the market makes a beautiful move that could have wiped out all of your previous losses. 
Chart patterns don't work 100% of time. Sometimes they don't even work 60% of times.
Wealthy traders don't get bothered by the idea that they have lost the previous trades. They trade with the same entusiasm they'd for the previous losing trades They know the statistics.

# They use naked charts and focus on zones
There are thousand of indicators and technical analysis strategies and every single one of them will work if back tested. 
Wealthy trades use a very few number of indicators that they have tested and found working.
Find one thing that you trade well.
The more stuff you have on a chart, the more confusing it gets.

# They realized long time agon that being uncomfortable trading is OK
Trading is not a comfortable job. You have to be comfortable being uncomfortable.
You are never gonna be in a postion when you will have 100% of your trades right. 
The sooner you realize this, the better you will perform in the market.
> Nobody is 100% correct about the market.

# The markets are their workplace. They are a participants, not an on-looker.

# They stopped trying to pick tops and buttoms
Quit trying to buy the tops and buttoms

# They stopped thinking about market being 'cheap' or 'expensive'
There is no cheap or expensive in the mind of wealthy trader. There is no such thing.
> Only thing they have in mind is if there is someone who is willing to pay more for this in a particular time frame.

# Buy higher highs and lower lows
Most people sell on higher highs and sell on lower lows. They think the market is going to bend. Look rule no. 9

# They are willing to change side, if the market tells them to do so
Making money is more important than being right. If you are not right, do what the market tells to do. You don't tell the market what to do. It will slap you in the face if you do so.
Eveybody have biases. If the market seems to do the opposite of it, go with the market. Don't hold on to your biases.

# They trade aggressively when trading well and modestly when they are not
You have to slow down when you are losing more and fasten up when you are getting more wins.

# They realise the market will be open again tomorrow
We all miss a trade sometimes that does exactly as we thought it to do. We all have the FOMO. Don't beat yourself up just because you missed a trade or lost it. The market is going to be open tomorrow again.

# They never add a losing trade... ever
If the trade is working against you, get out of it and moreover don't add to it. Don't do average. Unless you are among the .00001% of traders and trading in millions everyday.

# Cash is the goal, but never the measure of success
You don't have to measure your success with the cash you make every time. Heres what you should ask yourself everyday:
> Did I follow the rules when entering the trade or exiting it?

Following your rules should be your goal and cash will follow.
Be disciplined about your trades.

# They read books about mobs and riots
They read books about psychology. They understand that market is nothing more than a riot. There are human emotions playing in every single time in the market.

# They provide liquidity to the markets while watching price and volume
# They have a way to gauge fear, greed and speed of the markets
# They practice reading the right side of the chart, not the left
Everybody can see the patterns after they have been formed. Wealthy traders are better at reading and seeing those patterns when they begin to form.

Look at the last couple of bars and visualize what the next kind of bars will form like. Do that and you will be surprised at how good you do.

It's not about seeing the future. It's about seeing the patterns that are going to form.
# Every wealthy trader has an edge they can explain to their mothers.
If you can't explain someone simply how you earn money trading, you don't have an edge. It can be as simple as MA or RSI. 

> You gotta be able to articulate in an objective reason why you get into a trade and why you exit.

# Their position size is calculated exactly on risk tolerance
# One or two trades a month, make their month
They have a bunch of losers but a couple of trades that crushed it. They lose more than win. Their losses are always small because of their risk management

# Confidence decision makers in the face of lack of complete information
You gotta be confident even when you don't have complete information about a stock because you never will. 
# Losing trade don't mean they are a loser
Don't take it personally when the market slaps you to your face

# Their business isn't trading, it's finding the right trades.
Hitting buttons and executing a trade is their business, it's to find the right trades to execute on

# They write down or record every trade, price thoughts, news, attitude
You have to write down and review your behaviours and notice the patterns

# Their conviction on an active trade remains unless something major changes
Put a stop loss, set a profit target and get away.
# A winning trade doesn't result in the extra risk the next trade
Just because you are winning trades, don't think you will win always. Don't run in with extra risk to take on the next trade after winning trade.

# THEY TRADE REACIONS, NOT THE NEWS
Very few people can trade the news unless they are insider trading. You don't know what the reactions will be. 
> Don't trade the initial reactions, trade the reactions to reactions++

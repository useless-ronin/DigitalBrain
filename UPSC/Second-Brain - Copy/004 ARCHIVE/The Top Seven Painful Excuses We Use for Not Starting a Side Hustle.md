	- Quality work destroys competition. Focus on quality.

	- Making money is easy but figuring out how to make money is hard. 
	- Find a formula and it will turn you tiny side hustle to empire in few years.
	- Make your firs $10 first.
- I have no time
	- It's not your priority
	- You either want this or you don't. There is no such thing as 'No-time'
- **I fear** 
	- Embarassed to tell anybody 
	- New things makes us uncomfortable
	- Telling your friends and family can be a curse as well as blesssing.
	- Build your side-hustle in silence.
- **It's easier to be critic**
	- Criticizing takes no effort at all.
	- sit at home and juge everybody from the comfort of your couch with a bag of doritos.
	- Builders create their vision. Critics tear down someone else’s vision
	- The side hustle life is to build. The no side hustle life is to consume.
- **I don’t know what to do**
	- Would have been valid if there was no google or youtube
	- Drowning in information.
	- Curate good information. Spend your time going down the google rabbit holes.
	- Keep it adding to your notes.
	- Find ideas. Reaserch strategies and curate creators 
	- No one starts with an idea of what to do. It all starts with inspiration. Put up a vision board at home 
- **I'm not ready yet**
	- We're never ready. Its always scary to get from a place of your knowing to venture in an unknown place.
	- *Reminder — There are people worse than you at everything, getting paid way more than you because they didn’t wait till they were “ready”*
	- You can wait your entire life and die with your side hustle ideas still inside of you.


Starting a side hustle is easy. Making excuses about why it doesn’t work is hard.


## How to start
- Decide one goal
- Add a deadline that's uncomfortable and commit to it
- Work hard and be patient.

 When anything can be learned online, the barrier to education is simply:
 - Motivation
 - Curiousity
 - Persistence
 

 - Does this side hustle light a fire inside of you? If not, it’s going to be hard to get any motivation to do it. Are you curious about the areas connected to your side hustle? If not, your curiosity won’t be able to lead to creativity.
 - If the first two are missing then how the heck are you going to be persistent? You can’t
 - **Purpose;** How does this side hustle connect to a purpose bigger than you?
Attach a powerful why and you'll become unstoppable.

- Wired to feel discontent and grab easy reward for relief. 
- Solution: Be aware about the wiring and adapt to reality
- Procrastination, Youtube, Bing-watching,
- You are functioning exactly as you were designed
- way of pacifying and coping with pain and unease you feel
- **Designed to perpetually unhappy** For the purpose of motivation
- Evolution favored less happy ancestors. Who worked harder and were more likely to suffer
- Their unhappiness and dissatifaction fueled their motivation to get out there, take risk, use energy and change things for their advantage. 
- You saying, you are miserable as fuck.  I'm unhappy but still have no motivation. All I feel is depressed
- Take a step back. Get out of your bubble and look around
- Ancestors worked hard to relieve their unhappiness and discontent. They did something when they felt uncomfortable itch for something. 
- Took risk and ventured on dangerous missions. 
- Relieve never came easier in their life. There was a cost of hard work of days, weeks thousands and thousands of calories and even death. 
- The risk and reward were balanced. 
- Today is different
- Cost of reward is eliminated. 
- You can get anything within seconds. 
- There is no energy involved in doing something. 
- Living in modern utopia of abundance and security. But this living has side-effects.
- Obesity, addiction, depression, anxiety and mental illness has taken over the world. 
- No frame of reference to look what it was like before. We say this is normal. 
- We are impulsive, irrational, lazy nad inherently ungrateful creatures. 
- This is not normal.
- Normal is: 
- Hungy, horny, fearful, dissatisfied. So motivated to seek out and protect against predators, other tribes and dangers. Trying not to get killed for approaching the wrong one when finding a mated, 
- You did all those things, and survivied another day. Then for a brief moment you had inner-satisfaction
- What we are living in is ABNORMAL
- ABNORMAL is: You feel fearful, dissatisfied, horny, and then you grab your phone and scroll through to social media, fap to 14-year old hyper-fertile women, inhale some ultra processed and high caloric food
- These things work so weel and fast to quiet and numb our discontent. But it also makes you compelled to do it again and again and again until you have fried your brain receptors.
- To wake up everyday with the same motivation to relieve your pain quicky and temporarily 
- Living in abnormal time
- **What to do**
	- Use webblockers
	- Be an observer
		- Allow some pace to respond rather than reacting at the vice of relif

The trade is fair: Little pain and discomfort for some motivation to do some meaningful work. Investment that will pay off later with small doses of happiness and peace of mind

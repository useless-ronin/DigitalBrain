- First hours make you
- Traditional 9-5 not highly structured for productivity
- Perhaps was good when the work was mostly physical labour but not in the knowledge working world we live in.
- **Be clear on your priorities**. Don't do something just because he is oding it
- **Quality vs content**
- Intensive activity followed by high quality rest and recovery
- The best work happens in short intensive spurts.
- This must be 'Deep work'
- Spend 20% of your energy on work and rest on recovery and self-improvement.
- Immediately after your sleep, your mind is most readily active to do the thoughtful work
- Exercising first thing in the morning sucks my energy. Not any more. 
- Protein-rich food keeps you longer than other foods because they take longer to leave the stomach.
- I spend few minutes in prayer and meditation. and 5-10 minutes in journal to get clarity and focus for the day.
- I’ve been shocked by how easy it is to work for 2–5 hours straight without distractions. My mind is laser at this time of day. And I don’t rely on any stimulants at all.
- After workout,  you should be fine to work a few more hours if needed.
- **Protect your mornings**
	- Don't check social media or e-mail until after your 3 hours of deep work. 
- Your work schedule should be around the time when you work best, not around social norms and expectations.

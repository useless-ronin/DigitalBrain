## REVERSAL PATTERNS
They are technical clues. They signal shift in the market psychology and trend but don't confirm Trend reversal. Trend change happens in shifts slowly as the underlying psychology shift gears. 

Reversal signals are like the brake lights in car. It signals the stopping but don't show where it will go now. Therefore, we need more clues to know.

Reversal signs are caution that the market's psychology are in transformation. 

### Hammers & Hanging Man
| Hammer                                     | Hanging Man                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Formed after a decline(**Bullish signal**) | Formed at the top of the trend. All-time high             |
| Must comeafter a decline                   | Must come after a rally                                   |
| Valid even after a short-term decline      | Should emerge after extended rally or at an all time-high |
| No need of confirmation                    | Needs confirmation                                                          |

- **Criteria:**
	- Color is not important
	- Lower shadow at least twice the height of real body
	- very short, or no upper shadow
- **How to trade**
	- Minimize risks
	- Hammers also acts as support levels
	- Buy near the low of the hammer with risk appetite
	- Might not correct after a hammer in most cases of long shadow
	- Hanging man should close below its body in the next session for a better call.(*If the marke doesn't close under the hanging man's body, the trend remains uninterrupted*)
---
### Engulfing Patterns
Combination of two individual candle lines. Reversal sign with two opposite colored real bodies. 

- **Criteria**
	- Should be in a clearly definable trends even if its short-term
	- The second body **must** engulf the prior real body(need not to engulf the shadows)
	- The second body should be opposite the color of first except in case of doji
- **Important turning signal if:**
	- First day has a very small real body(spinning top) and second day has a long rel body
	- If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the engulfing pattern
	- If engulfing patterns appears after a very fast move.
- **How to trade:**
	- The highs or lows acts as support and resistance for stop loss
	- Wait for the close of second session before confirming this pattern
	- For breakout confirmation, wait for close not just intraday break. 

--- 
### Dark-Cloud Cover
Engulfing pattern like but unable to engulf the whole prior days real body. Strong white body on first day and second day's price opens with a gap up and closes deeply within the prior days body. Requires 50% peneteration in the body. Wait for confirmation if so doesn't happen.
- **Important turning signal if:**
	- Greater penetration into of black body into the prior real body
	- Shaven head and shaven bottom with no shadows occured in the both candles.
	- Second day opens above a major resistance and bulls fail to take control of the market
	- Can acts as a resistance just like bearish engulfing pattern(Don't sell if the candle closes way below the high. Not good from the perspective of risk-reward)

#### The importance of protective stops
Helps you against the unanticipated price movements. Should be set at the time of placing a trade because thats when you are the most objective. Don't stay in the trade if market doesn't perform according to your expectations. Exit before its two late: The most imporatnt thing in trading is **Capital preservation**.

> Lose your opinion, not your money. 

What's worse than being wrong is staying wrong. 

---
### Piercing pattern
They are the oppposite of dark cloud cover. Formed in a downtrend. Signals a bullish move. The white body should penetrate 50% inside prior days large black candle. The second day candle should form with a gap down. and move upwards from there.

A non-ideal candle can also be viewed as 
- Where it was formed within the overall market picture
- How it was formed 
---
## STARS
Start is a small real body that gaps away from the large prior body. Real bodies doesn't overlaip. Doji star is a warning the tred may be ending,

### The morning star and evening star
| Morning Star            | Evening Star          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Bullish pattern         | Bearish pattern       |
| Forms after a downtrend | Forms after a uptrend |
|                         |                       |


- **Criteria:**
	- First candle should have a extended real body
	- Second candle should have a small real body. Not touching the prior real body
	- The candle should be a real body that intrudes deeply into the first sessions extended real body
	- *Lack of gap weakens the power of this formation*
One might have to wait till the formation of three candles before entering a trade. Might not possess an attractive risk/reward ratio. **Wait for correction to the stars support or resistance area**

- **The formation becomes more powerful if:**
	- If there is no overlap between the first, second and the third real bodies
	- If the third candle closes deeply into the first candle's real body
	- If there is light volume on first candle and heavy volume on the third session.

> If a market makes a new low and can't maintain these new lows, it is frequently a hint of reversal.

> If a market makes a new high and can't maintain these new highs, it is frequently a hint of a reversal.

- **Morning and evening dojis stars:**
	- Evening or morning star with a small doji instead of a small real body. It can be a meaningful bottom or top.
- **Abandoned baby bottom and top:**
	- Doji formed at a gap in a morning or evening star
	- More strong signal of reversal

| Shooting Star                     | Inverted Hammer                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Formed at the top of the trend    | Formed at the bottom of trend     |

## MORE REVERSAL PATTERNS
Previous are more powerful signals. They show that one side has take power. Usually but not always less powerful reversal signals. 
### The Harami Pattern
- Long body followed by a small real body's unceratanity. 
- The small read body opening and closing near previous days open-close range increases the probabiltity. 
- Real body inside previous day's body. Shadow may or mayn't be above or below
#### Harami Cross
- The smaller the real body, the more potent the pattern. 
- The real body is a doji
- Also called petrifying pattern
- Can be seen at bottoms but more effective at tops
> Trend change doesn't necessarily mean prices will go from up to down or down to up. Sometimes, it can stay neutral for a long time. 


### Tweezer Tops & Bottoms
- Two or more candle lines matching highs or lows
- Long first candle and small real body in the next session
- Tweezers can be confirmed by other candlestick indications for valuable forecasting
- Use combination of lines to act upon tweezers
### Belt-Bold Lines
- Bullish and bearish
- For bullish: Candle opens on high of the session or within a few ticks and continues lower through the session
- The longer the height, the more significant it becomes
- Close above the bearish belt-hold line means continuation of uptrend
- Close below bullish belt-hold line means new selling pressure
- More important if they confirm resistance or other belt-hold lines or if they have not appeared for a while
### Upside-Gap Two Crows
- Occurs rarely
- The market gaps higher on the open, fails to maintain the new high. A new day, bulls still fail to maintain the high. If this happens, expect lower prices.
- Gap up means a bullish sign
- View it as less bearish than no gap
### Three Black Crows
- Consecutive three declinging candles
- Bad news
- Useful for long-term traders
### Three Advancing Soliders
- The opposite of three black crows
Using black crows and advancing soldiers don't present an attractive Risk reward ratio.

### Three Mountains, Three Rivers
- Represnts a major top and a major bottom.
- Has a nearly same highs
- Special type if the middle mountain is the highest mountain, also called the buddha top(Similar to head & shoulders pattern).
- Opposite of three moutanis is the three rivers, Inverted three buddha
### Counterattack lines
- Opposite colored candles have same close
- The first candle has a long black body. The next session opens sharply lower.
- Bearish and bullish counterattackl lines
- Bearish counterattack lines similar to dark cloud cover but doesn't go into the prior body.
- Dark cloud cover more potent than bearish counterattack line
- Bullish caounterattack line should be respected. It show the change in the  direction of market. 
### Dumpling Tops & Frypan Bottoms

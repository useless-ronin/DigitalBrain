- Market rewards one side and punishes the another. 
- Moves from structure to structure squeezing one side of market.
- Liquidity: Makes market functional and competitive. Ample buyers and sellers
- **Liquidity hunting:** Flushing the losing players out of the market by smart money
- Smart money knows how retail traders think. They will push the market above the normal zone before pulling it down. They will push you out of your position before taking move.
- 
- Consistency os structural symmetry
	- Clear outs happen around structures where price consistently bounces before it breaks
	- Focus only on such strucuters for liquidity clearouts
- Time plays a role in key liquidity zones
- Join market makers instead of fighting them in the hunt.
- The market should rotate sharply after hunt. 30 minutes for stocks and 1-15 minutes for crypto and forex.

- In trend lines the lowest low will be the key level.
- **Triggered by market maker or targeted by the whole market?**
	- where price starts the actual move?
	- Strong moves are symmetrical while targeted clearouts will be initiated in the middle of structure where there is no liquidity. **(Fast, aggressive candles, Quick reversel)**
- The price reverses quickly (first 3-5 candles)
- The volume should be significant.
- The faster, the better
- No symmetry, harder entry

- **PLAN**
- Use price alerts
	- price alerts is critical to minimize screen time and be more patient and fresh as a trader.

**Note:** The price should be reclaimed at the support or resistance. If it doesn't, it's a breakout not clearout.



Liquidity huntin=Stop-loss hunting.

# How to Set Right Goals
When you are setting goals, ensure that you are not just making a wish. You should make sure that you can not imagine you life without making this goal true. If you don't make your goals absolute necessity in your life, you won't achieve it.

# The Fundamentals Of UFS
The book doesn't gurantee whether you'll achieve your goals or not. They are only done by fake gurus. But if you follow the tips in this book, it can make a big difference in your life. This is not a magical book that will solve the problem just by reading it. You'll need to take actions on your part. And if you can't take actions, this book is not for you.

# Start
The fewer goals you have, the more likely you are to achieve them. So, before setting goals, you want to choose as few goals as possible. But, it doesn't necessarily mean you aren't allowed to do anything besides working on them. It just means that when you limit your focus, you'll be more dedicated towards your fewer objectives.

Trying to make a balance between many goals in your life at the same time might seem fancy but is unrealistic.

## Sacrifice is Necessary
You have to sacrifice your less important goals for the better ones. The more you're willing to sacrifice, the more you'll be able to dedicate yourself to your vital goal.
You don't have to sacrifice things that you can't get later. So, smart sacrifice would sound better here. Don't sacrifice essential health-related and relationship-related goals. Once these are lost, its hard or even impossible to gain them back.

> Tell yourself, you won't do something until you achieve your goal.

## How to Set the Right Goals or Goals

The goals you choose to focus on should be important. They should be so important that you can't even imagine your life without accomplishing them. If you don't consider your goals as an absolute must, you won't probably achieve it.

Your goals shouldn't be just a mere wish. They should be much more than that. If you don't have a deep desire for the goals set to achieve, you have to reconsider them. Your goal should be so important to you that you have the mentality of "making it happen or die trying".

### How to Be More Clear About Which Goals to Pursue
You may have several goals that you want to achieve. But trying to achieve all of them at once will not only slow down your process but also make you less likely to succeed at any. Here are three simple techniques you can use to decide which goals are important for you:

Flip a coin
 Assign a goal to each side of the coin and flip it. Now, you will find yourself rooting for one of the goals even before the coin lands. Pay close attention to the inner voice and chose the goal.
 The reason this method works better than analyzing each goals is because when it comes to your goals, your gut often knows best

Think about your most important values
 What are your key values in your life? Find the values that you want to live your life with and if your goal aligns with your value, that's it, it's your goal.
 
You have unsual patience for it
 If you don't have unsual patience for your goal, you'll quit very soon. Your goal should be your top priority and you should have the ability to wait for it even when everybody around you doubts in your ability.
 
### Make Your Goals Realistic
Don't aim too high and don't aim too low too. You have to find the sweet spot between the both to make sure your goal is appropriate.

## How to Find The Right Motivation
Motivation is the starting point of every action. But it also the other way. There are mainly three types of motivation;
- Extrensic motivation: When you are doing something primarily get reward, often tangible, you are extrinsically motivated. When you do something to avoid some form of punishment, it is also called extrensic motivation. Most people seek are looking for extrinsic motivation because it is the most common type of motivation. However, it is also the most fickle one. Motivation goes away if the reward or danger of punishment disappears. This certainly doesn't mean this type of motivation is uselss. You shouldn't primarily depend on this type of motivation to achieve your goals
- Intrinsic motivation: It is a motivation that comes from within. It is also not dependent on external reward and punishment. And it is often stronger than extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation can be a feeling of fun, happiness, a desire to overcome challanges or th need of independence and control. People who are intrinsically motivated to achieve more in life simply because they are not dependent on something external.
- Prosocial motivation: It is the most effective form of motivation. When you are motivated to help others in the society and care for others, it is called prosocial motivation. Humans have evolved to be social being through history. the desire to help others makes us go the extra mile. When you think beyond yourself, you'll have one of the most powerful allies to your side.

## Before You Start Do This
You won't regret starting sooner than later. But in some cases, waiting might be a more reasonable option. Understand the circumstances and that you and your goals are in. 

Sleep on your goals before you start taking actions
 Don't make decisions right away. I've found that it's easy to feel the pump and motivation to do something later in the day. Therefore, it's helpful sleep on your goal before taking action.
 When you sleep on your goal, ther is more logic involved in your thought process. 
 
Am I okay with all the dark side of working on my goal?
 When you are working on your goal, there won't always be sunshines. You will have to make certain sacrifices. The goal of becoming financially free might require you to dedicate years of your life to it. 
 When you will succeed, people will often envy your success and turn away from you.
 Are you okay with the fact that you will have to write everyday if you want to be best selling author.
 
 ## Plan Your Goals
 Break down your goals in small steps and take it from there. Think big, but start small. It might be tempting when you are all excited and motivated for your goal. But to focus on small task and start from there will be a wise choice. If your goal is to climb Mt. Everest, learning how to rope climb first may be a better choice.
 
 ## Doubts and Fear you might have
 How to balance several goals at once
  It's possible to just choose one or two goal and push others to the side in an ideal world. But that's not always the case. You need to work on multiple goals at once. In this case, prioritization is important. Goals that are important should be focused first keeping others aside to do.
  
  I'm afraid of failure [page 65 on single page]
   A lot of people hesitate to start because they are afraid of failure. As childrens we are not afraid of failure. But as we grow, we are consumed by this fear. People don't understand failure is a part of success. The easiest way to succeed is to try, fail, learn and repeat until you achieve it.
   You should fail more. It will also make you more resilient and persistent as an individual as you expose yourself to external stimulus of failure.
   
  I'm afraid of success
   This may sound strange. But people are subconsciously afraid of success. It makes them hesitant to start and even sabotage their efforts.
   How will happen if i became a influencer or succeed. Will they support me or turn their backs on me. Or will they be envious of me?
   It's always scary to work on your goal because you are leaving your comfort  zone and walking into the unknowns.

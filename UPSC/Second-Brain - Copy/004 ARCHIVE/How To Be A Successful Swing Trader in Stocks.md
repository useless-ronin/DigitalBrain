## Important Lessons
- Always have the downside target and your plan for countering. You can absolutely get crushed on a single trade
- You can't be right 100% of the time. Admitting that is hard but you will see more wins once you start doing it
- **Swing Trading Vs Day Trading?**
	- Day trading is hard. You have to be looking at the charts all the time. Swing trading is the safer bet.
	- Swing trading has less pressure. 
- Companies with less volatility are the ones that you can hold for the long-term
- Don't get married to a single stock. The market is constantly changing. Sometimes even the best companies will perform worst. Its okay to say fuck it and take your favorite company out of your watchlist
- **Profit:** 
	- 3-5% is more reaasonable and achievable. Look at their average volatility before setting targets. 
	- 10-20% is achievable and adds up quickly. People get lucky with 100-300% return. But if luck runs out, strategy is the only thing that will help you survive.
- **Trading breakouts or retests?**
	- Retests are good but often you will miss the strong moves
	- Stocks that perform best won't wait for retest. They will run.
	- Only trading breakouts will cause you to miss out on big opportunities
- **CUT YOUR LOSSES AND LET YOUR PROFITS RUN**
- False breakouts and divergences increase profitability. They are a very good trading signals.
- **For swing traders, charts below 4H not reommended**
- Buy the rumor, sell the news. They are the market catalyst
- **Stick to the plan**
- **Risk Management, Technical And Fundamentals**
- **You can't time the market.** 
	- Don't kick yourself for missing out profits or opportunities. There will always be more 
- 
- **Most of all, Survive:** If you can't survive a year where all indexes are negative you won't make it.
- **Trading is harder than ever:**
	- You are not trading against humans. You are against bots. They are much better than you. They can enter and exit the trades without emotions. They are perfect. They are better at exploiting any edge that you think you have. 
- Journal your trades. Study your trades and your behaviors. Only you are your saviour.

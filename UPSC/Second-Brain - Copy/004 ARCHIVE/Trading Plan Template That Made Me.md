> A plan helps you follow your strategy, keep your emotions on check and be a consistently profitable trader. 

The market is always right. Don't get attached to your opinion or view of why one thing should happen. The market is always irrational at times because it is made by humans who most of the time don't have to make sense. 

Trading is a mind game. Mastering your own psychology is a must if you want to succeed as a trader.

> Look for price action to either jump or fade a move.
- You can be profitable with less than 50% win rate if your money management is up to the par
- 
For day trading, you want to look for hight probabitliy setups. The trade needs to go into your intended direction more or less immediately.

Put stop loss to break even as soon as the trade starts making profit. This keeps enough room for the trade to run while protecting your captial.

Study, study, study. Instead of doing social media, do courses. Read books. Revise your plans. Learn from others. 

Focus on RR, profit factor, and expectancy instead of just win rate. Win rate doesn't tell whether you are profitable or not.

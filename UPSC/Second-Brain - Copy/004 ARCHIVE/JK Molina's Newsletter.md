- How I got my first tweeting client
	- Pretty impressive reach out in examples. Re-follow them
- Traffic
	- No matter how bad someone is with women, if they talk to 100 different women, he'll eventually get the one that likes him
	- No matter how bad your landing page or product is, if you get million people see it, you'll eventually get a sale.
		- Traffic solves a lot of problems but its only a part of the equation
- OFFERS
	- It's what you give to people in exchange for their money
	- Your target market has money. And they want to spend it. But they're not going to spend it in a product or service. They're going to spend it in aÂ **magic box**:
	- A box where they can get $3 by puttin in $1
- Good offere+Traffic =Big $$$

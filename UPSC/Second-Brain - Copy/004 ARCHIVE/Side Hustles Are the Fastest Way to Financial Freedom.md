- Your profession doesn't have to run your life
- If your goal is to make money, you don't have to follow the traditional path
	- The problem with all these strategies is they’re slower than a horse and cart. They’re old school. They’re out of date. And they don’t factor in new norms
- Technology has created side hustles and provided a faster way to financial freedom.
- Don’t waste your days working on one thing but always thinking about another
- If you sit at work most days and dream of doing another type of work then why do you torture yourself? If you only had days to live you wouldn’t accept this outcome. So why do you accept it when you’re not guaranteed to live for any fixed length of time
- If you can make $20 online, you can make $100K+
- It’s a process. The quicker you start the process, the quicker you can stop wasting time at work, living like a zombie.
- The money from a side hustle doesn’t firehose its way into your wallet. It takes time and patience, two things most people don’t have
- Side hustles are the fastest way to financial freedom if you’re willing to invest five years of your life. If not, try the other options that take decades of your life to achieve — just don’t complain.

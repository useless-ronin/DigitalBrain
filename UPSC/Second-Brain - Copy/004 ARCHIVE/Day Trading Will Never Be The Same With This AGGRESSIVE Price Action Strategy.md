- Wick are important for analysis. They determine the psychology of market participants.
- long upper shadows= bearish sign. Multiple long upper shadows after price advance means its reaching the top. Not enough demand at the higher prices to continue upward at least for short term
- Same for the lower shadow

Lower shadow reflects the amount of buying pressure.

Your job is to find the buying and selling pressure zones with longer lower and upper shadows. 


***Don't see charts as price movements, see it as traders who are making decisions.***

**Don't just look at the single bar. Be cautious about how a group of price bars look** The appearance of single bar is not sufficient for a trading setup. Look for at least 3 consecutive bars with overlapping upper shadows.

Avoid small wicks. Increase their threshold as necessary

# Bullish & Bearish pressure zones 
- Find 3 or more overlapping bars and wicks and 
- Markout highest closing price and high price and this is bearish pressure zone. The area between these price levels is pressure zone

# Long Entry
- Find bullish pressure zone
- Buy above next bullish bar


If price breaks below the pressure zone, the setup becomes invalid.


# Short Entry
- Find bearish zone
- Sell below the next bearish bar that overlaps with the pressure zone
- If price enters again to the pressure zone, you can re-enter/
The setup becomes invalid if the pressure zone is broken



***Moving averages will be invalid in a ranging market. But they will work accurately in a trending market.***

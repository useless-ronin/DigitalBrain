**Title:** The Daily Laws

**Type:** #litnote #book 

----
Our brain evolved in a highly sensitive environment to detect any changes in the weather, anticipating the presence of predators and finding opportunites for where food might lie.

We have the same brain designed for the same purpose. The dangers in our environmet have been more subtle. Now we don't have to fear tigers but rather the tricky, pyschological and social games others play.

Our culture fills our head with what human nature should be like, rather than what they are actually like. We think we are victims and we are not responsible for anything that happens to us.

The daily laws is a result of twenty-five years of intense research on the subject of power, persusasion, strategy, mastery, and humna nature. It is a distillation of knowledge from all the books, interviews, and talks of Robert Greene designed to reverse these toxic patterns and to reconnect us to the reality.

This book is divided into 366 small parts that can be read in a pick-and choose manner or skipping around as you desire. But as you read, take notes as often as you can to relate entries to your own experiences of the past and the present.


## Discovering your calling
We express ourselves in a different way in the childhoowd. The forces within us come from a deeper place than our consciousnes. The first step to move towards mastery is to connect with that innate force and let it guide your life. you were obsessed with something as a child for a reason. Reconnect with it.

What you need to find is already within you. You have nothing to create and nothing to dig. 

You don't have to tie yourself to particular position. You don't have to abandon the skills and experience you have gained, but to find a new way to apply them. Avoid having rigid goals and dreams.

Don't be desperate about anything. Be relaxed. Concentrate on maintaining a high sense of purpose and the success will flow to you naturally. Don't be embarassed about being different. Being different is a superpower. Embrace your strangeness and Guse things together to become an anmoly. Always stick to what makes you weird, odd, strange, different. That's your source of superpower.

Resist the temption to be like others. Instead direct yourself towards the small things that you are good at and expand outwards

- Not-to-do list is more important than what to do
# Not-to-do
-  Don't chase the price. 
- Trading is not a game. Its business and you should treat it like so.

### Why people lose
- You risk too much. It eventually hurts you in the long run
- You don't have a strategy
- Dig deep on how your trades are performing. 
- Why you are losing. Why you are revenge trading. Figure out what makes  you emotional. \
- Start small so that you don't have to be nervous. Baby steps
> Your job as a trader is to be as perfect as you can. Don't let the market control you. Control yourself. Enter when your strategy tells you to. Exit when your strategy tells you to. 
> You can't control the market. You can control following your loss, moving  your stop loss. moving your targets
> 

# Things to Do(Plan)
- Market seems random but it is not.
- You are a manager of your trades. Learn to manage your trades
### Why are you buying
### Where are you buying
### Where are you exiting
### Where is your stop loss


- Figure out if you are a **Breakout trader** or a **pullback trader**
- What key levels are  you going to use?
	- Support and resistance
	- Trend lines
	- Supply and demand
- What is the market doesn't go to key levels? Wait for another opportunity. Who cares about 1 when there are opportunities every second. ***Don't force anything***


- You can't enter a market and guess. You have to know everything before you enter the field. You have to take action the moment it the market agrees with your strategy. You have to know all the details before you enter a trade. Know the amount you are gonna put in a trade.
- Don't force a trade if you don't see anything.

- ***Trading is a surviving game.***
- Make sure you do the same thing over and over and over again. 
- Take screenshots. Write in journals. Put out the right energy and you will get good results.

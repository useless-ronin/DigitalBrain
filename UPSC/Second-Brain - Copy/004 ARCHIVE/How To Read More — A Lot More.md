When I say I read a lot of books, people assume I speed read. No, I don't. And I'm telling you speed reading is BS.
Do you say I don't have time for eating 3 meals? No, Then why do you say you don't have time for reading. 
You only have time for what you prioritize. Reading must come to you as natural as eating and breathing to you. 

Tips to Read More 
# Carry a book always
Carry a book with you at all times. Every time you get a second, crack it open. Don’t install games on your phone–that’s time you could be reading. When you’re eating, read. When you’re on the train, in the waiting room, at the office–read. It’s work, really important work. Don’t let anyone ever let you feel like it’s not.

# Buy More Books
Erasmus said "When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes.” If you see something that's interesting, don't put it on your list, but it at the moment.  Don’t wait around for some book you want to read to come out in paperback–trying to save $2 or $3 is the wrong mindset. If it’s a book you’ll read, then read it now, not in a year.

# Don't Forget the Purpose of Reading Books
Humans have been writing for a long time. Anything that you are stuggling with, there's already a solution for it written somewhere. Read more books and save yourself fromt he trial-and-error.

If you want to read more, there's no secret. You just have to read. Adjust your priorites and your perception so that reading becomes an extension of who you are and what you do.

	- Day 19: Create a physical structure
		- Your memory is malleable
		- With the right strategies, you can raise your intelligence
		- For writers, it can be externalizing ideas
		- Post it notes are better for long-from essays. They are better than linear structures. 
		- Post it notes help for book and long-form essays.

		- But even if you don't know what you are gonna write about. you should write something. Your work will carry you forward
		- Just as enterpreneurs don't wait to start a company until they know exactly how they are going to build it, you shouldn't wait either until you have an outlined every single sentence.
		- You have to build islands as many as you can and narrow them to build bridges between them.
	- Day 26: Hide your work
		- Your work is done when it looks so simple that the consumer thinks they could have done it, which means they won't appreciate how hard you worked.
		- Easy reading is hard writing.
		- You should hide your writing and publish only  a small percentage of what you read.
		- Writing begins with creating phase and ends with deletion.
		- Elegance is the end result of hard work, not the starting point. Strive to make your work so invisible that the reader thinks they could also have written what you published.

		- 2 ways to avoid plagiarism:
			- Give the author credit for his ideas
			- When in doubt, acknowledge the sources of your ideas
		- There's nothing under the sun. Even if you want to be original. Aim to create an original premise instead of using only original ideas.

	- Day 31: Intellectual Phase Transition:
		- Just like matter changes in physics. The ideas never change, the way you present them is what changes.
		- Antoine Lavoisier who said: “Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.”

		- Write ideas that are important but distracting. 
		- Externalize them so that you can come back next time

		- Here's a FAST writing guide
		- **Find:**
			- Take notes to save your best ideas. Because research can be stressful.
			- Note-taking is a passive research. 
		- **Assemble:**
			- Don't write with a blank page. Create a long-list of scattered ideas relating to your topic. This will ignite your creativity.
			- Writing without a note-taking system is like trying to build a campfire withot a pile of wood. 
			- Assembling your notes or ideas helps you spark your own creativity
		- **Speak:**
			- Speaking makes writing easy. It helps you develop ideas 
			- It forces you to structure and develop ideas.
			- The more you can think in conversations you are already having, the more refined your ideas will be when you start typing.
		- **Teach:**
			- Sharing your ideas with others is the best way to learn. 
			- It create various feedback loops in the process which makes you better at a topic.
		- To write regularly, you have to write fast and you won't have the time for slow methododlogy
		- Day 38: The three deadly sins
			- Redundant words say the same thing twice, wasted ones don’t serve a purpose, and weak ones lack meaning.
			- Don’t write “Eddie was a kind, generous, and thoughtful person” when you can call him a “saint.”
			- Don’t write “He passed away early in the morning, and people all over America cried” when you can write “He died at dawn and the nation wept.”
			- Wasted words slow the momentum of your writing. Redundant words make reading less interesting
			- Whenever you can reduce your sentence to five words instead of 10, without altering the meaning, do it. 
			- Compress your sentences to make them short and sweet.
	- Day 39: Expression is compresssion

		- Create a rythm: 
			- Make your words dance. Make sentences short and long. Mix them in between. Short will speed things up. Long will slow them down. Write in combination of short, medium and long sentences
		- Link your sentences:
			- Let every sentence follow the other. Connect one sentence with other. You shouldn't leave a hole in paragraphs
		- Add colorful details:
			-  “Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the reader, not the fact that it’s raining, but the feeling of being rained upon.”
			- Write data,facts,quotes, annectdotes and make readers feel like ther are reading something good.
		- Remove unnecessary detail
			- First remove unnecessary words and information and make your sentences clear. You have to respect the time of reader
		- You'll have to delete most of what you write but this will help your writers find something beautiful to read. 
	- Day 41: **CRIBS** my mistake feedback formula
		- Feedbacks can be powerful. Most people don't know how to give feedbacks. This makes writing feel worthless and dejected
		- You can be an editor with this simple formula:
		- **Confusing:**
			- Don't try to sound smart. Your goal is to communicate clearly. Confusing writing also means that you haven't thought properly abotu what you will read.
		- **Repeated:**
			- Don't repeat yourself. Make it as consise as possible. It's a self-insult to repeat yourself. 
			- Delete things that repeat them or write clearly
		- **Interesting:**
			- Write interesting ideas otherwise no one will read your work online. That's what makes you unique to your audience
		- **Boring:**
			- Nobody tolerates boredom with a phone in their hand. You have to make them engaged. Skip the sections that cause the audience to wander.
			- Delete or rewrite things when you find something boring.

		- You can't change the consumption patterns of people no matter how much good product you create.
		- Differentiation is free marketing in the online world
		- Avoid competition to rise faster
		- Build something on your own terms and own a niche you create
	- Day 45: Get Wonky
		- As Patrick says: "On the internet, the more focused you are, **the more wonky and niche you are**, the bigger your audience is. I think the internet rewards the edges of distributions, and I just happened to be really interested in one of those edges, which was **deep, wonky business and investing discussions**.”
		- Have enthusiastic interest in the specialized details of your domain.
		- Wonkiness gives you free ideas that nobody has ever seen before
	- Day 46: Find your scenius

	- Day 47: One big idea
		- Our obsession with learning has descendeed into an obsession with consumption.
		- More information doesn't make you more bettter.
		- Study a panoramic idea for long enough and you’ll start to see its effects everywhere. People with intimate knowledge of One Big Idea monopolize a narrow band of the light spectrum, which gives them access to ideas and opportunities regular people miss.
		- The world is pregnenet with opportunities which reveals themselves to us once we decide what we want to see.
		- “In the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship." - David Foster'

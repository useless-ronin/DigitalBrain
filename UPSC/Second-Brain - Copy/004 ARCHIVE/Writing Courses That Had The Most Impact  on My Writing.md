I'm not one of those writers who fell in love and started writing when I was in grade 4. It has not been more than two years since I started writing and I have improved myself little by little everytime in this writing journey.

Here are some lessons everyone can learn 

### Cut out the unnecessary fluff

- There are articles and blog posts that are overfilled with words just to make the content weightier than it should be.
- Although it's good to write like you speak, you should cut our most of the unnecessary words out if they don't add anything to your sentence. 

### Write with verbs not nouns
We often convert verbs into nouns. We use words like failure, instead of fail. reaction instead of react. When you use these types of words, you convert verbs into nouns. If you find yourself using more nouns instead of verbs, try to restore the nouns to their original verb forms like: distract, inform. eliminate.

This forces you to reveal the subject performing those actions and give life to your sentence.

### Don't use "to be" verb

### Eliminate Negatives
It's easy to use negative words instead of whole sentences. For example: Instead of writing: "I'm not happy at the moment", you can write, "I'm unhappy at the moment"

### Add some rhetorical devices to make you sentence pop.

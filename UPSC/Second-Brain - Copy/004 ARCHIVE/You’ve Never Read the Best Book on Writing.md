- The reader expectation approach
- **Sentence**
	- they take shape of arguments and ideas
	- More complex ideas require more complex sentences
	- *Topic position controls the meaning of the sentence*
	- *Verb is the action of sentence*
	- *Stress position happens when theres punctuation mark which suggests full syntactic closure*. Stress position changes the meading of sentence
	- Placing subject near to the topic position, gives the idea of whose story it is.
- **Paragraphs**
	- Topic changing creates a flow that lead the reader through your arguments and ideas.
	- Topic stringing mean using the same topic in topic position for each sentence in a series of sentences. 
- **Documents**
	- the last sentence of the paragraph before the beginning of the main discussion will be the contract statement.
	- the point of the document is to discuss, extend, or refine the arguments and ideas in the contract statement.
- **Punctuation**
	- They tell you when to breathe, when to interrupt your main train of thought, and how severely to do so. They inform you when to raise a question and when to read with the power of an exclamation
	- By using the correct punctuation in the correct way, you as the writer can create sentences, paragraphs, and documents that clearly communicate your arguments and ideas.
	- *Period signals the end of sentence*
	- *The point of using a colon is to have “the essence of the first clause repeated, but stated differently, in some helpful way*
	- *The semi-colon suggests a further expansion of thought, or a deeper development, or at least a significant and related addition*
	- *The em-dash, parenthesis, and commas denote an interruption in a sentence, but each provides a distinct emphasis in the interruption.*
- Readers need to know not only then can take a ‘breath’ at a comma but also precisely which kind of ‘breath’ to take.
-  Reader cares about the following 4 questions only
	- **What is going on here?**
	- **Whose story is this?**
	- **How does this sentence connect backwards and forwards to its neighbors
	- **What word or words in this sentence should be read with special emphasis because they are the stars of this show?
 
 “Of most importance is the recognition that you, as a writer, are the one in control of the structural placement of any and all of your information. By organizing that structure, you transform information into ideas. A professional is someone who is paid to articulate the connections”

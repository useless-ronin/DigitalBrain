Some people do and some don't.
Some buy and some don't.
Some change and some don't.
Some believe and some don't.
And you just have to leave it that way.

You can usually workout the numbers. Out of 10, only 2 or 3 will do. Rest, they don't Whatever business or field you go in. Why don't they do? Well we don't know. Just leave it as a mystery. You don't need to understand that. Take a simple approach.

> Jim Rohn calls this the "Mystery of Mind"

# Be Thankful For What you Have
There's always something in everyone's life to be thankful for. It opens the door, windows, channels.
# Listen Well
# Take Notes
# Don't be a follower, be a good student
# Take advice, not orders
Make sure what you do is the result of your own conclusions. Take what someone else says, think, ponder, then take action that is the product of your own conclusions.

## 5 FUNDAMENTALS TO MAKE ALL THE CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE

# Philosophy
You can't blame nobody. Your life is completely your own responsibility. The ability to think, use your mind, process ideas and not just operate by instincts is what seperates us from the rest of the life forms. 

Don't curse the only things you have. Don't complain about the only thing you've got to work with.

If you blame the only thing that you've got to work with, you are going no where. You can't change the system, economy, market and any other things. So if you want to change your life and future, you have to change your philosophy.

> A few errors and judgement repeated everyday will accumulate into disaster. Just because disaster doesn't fall on the same day doesn't mean it isn't coming.

> A few simple disciplines practiced everyday will bring fortune. If you do this, you have begun to change your life around.

Your philosophy is gonna determine whether you are gonna go for disciplines or going for potential disasters. You don't have to ask for another  country or planet. Just ask for another book, seminar or idea.

# Attitude
You have to have a good attitude about everyone and everything else. If someone can do, you can do it too. That should be your attitude. 
> Life change doesn't start with inspiration, It starts with education.
> If a guy is an idiot and you motivate him, he is now a motivated idiot.

# Activity
God says, "Plant the seed and I'll grow the tree." Turning wisdom and attitude into activity, you can have a miracle. 
> Do what you can. Do the best you can.

**You could change, you should change, you won't change. That's called accumulated disaster.**

In a matter of time you will be explaining instead of celebrating.

Only because we don't quite understand how it works doesn't mean, it doesn't work. It works. We don't simply understand how it works.

Get a list of stuffs you could do but haven't done and postponed and clean up that list first. You can't start a better life change process than cleaning off what you have been putting off.

Don't walk like other people walk. Don't postpne like other people postpone. 

It's not the economy that's gonna determine your next 5 years, It's your philosophy about the economy, your attitude and your actions.

# Results
Everyonce in a while you should take a measure of your activity. Results is the name of the game.
> How many books have you read in the last 90 days? Every wisdom is available in books?

Start with one discipline and then another and another and another. Each disciplines feeds on the previous one.

# Lifestyle
Lifestyle is simply learning how to live well.
> If you wish to be wealthy, study wealth. 

Commit to this: "5 years from now, nobody is gonna be able to say how come you don't have a superior plan, living in a superior country with a superior oppotunity."

> If you want to be happy, study happiness.

Happiness is something you design. It is a practice, art and skills. And anyone studying can learn it.
Everythings available within your reach. All you have to do is be committed.

## PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
Its not what happens that determines the major part of your future, what happens happens to everybody, the key is what you do about it.
Whatever you have right now, you have attracted these things because of the person you have become.
You don't have to change what's outside, you have to change what's inside.

> To have more, you simply have to become more. Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills.

You get paid for the value you provide to the market. You don't get paid for the time you take although it will take time to provide value to the market. 
If you are getting paid $20 because that's whats your value is. If you want to get paid more, you have to learn to be more valuable.

Learn to work harder on yourself than your job. 
If you work hard on your job, you'll make a living. If you work hard on yourself, you'll make a fortune.

### Human history in 1 sentence
> Opportunity mixed with difficulties.

## Life is Like Seasons

### learn to handle winters
you can't get rid of the winters by checking off january and feburary from the calendar. Here's whats you can do: Be wiser, stronger and better.

### Learn how to handle springs
Springs follow winters. Spring is called opportunity. Take advantage of the opportunity. There are only handful of springs that we're given so learn to take advantage of it swiftly and quickly.

> Whatever you gotta do, do it. Don't let it pass away.

### Learn how to nourish in the summer
The day you plant your seeds, there will be obnixous weeds and busy bugs are out to take it. They will take it unless you prevent it. You gotta nourish your values like a mother during these times. Summer is the season of opportunity and threat both.

### Learn to reap in the fall
It's not the seed, soil, or seasons to criticize. It's all your responsibilty. No complaint, no apology. 

## Physical Development
>  Treat your body like a temple. It's the only place you get to live.

Some people don't do well in life, because they don't feel well. People feed their dogs better than they feed their kids.
- Appearance: God looks on the inside, people look in the inside. You may say that people shouldn't judge you by how you look, but they do. At first they are gonna take a look. Make sure your outside is a major reflection of what's going on the inside.
- Spiritual: Human beings are more than a advanced species of animals. Study and practice your values and virtues if you do believe on sprituality.
- Mental: Learn, study, grow, change. Human development takes time. Somethings, you can't cover in a few weeks. Feed the mind. Some people read so little. Some people can't give a good strong arguments as to their personal beliefs. You gotta be able to defend your values and virtues.
- Library: Get a library started, that's gonna change your life. Start acting intelligent. You should be a serious student of life, skills, values, history, health, mind, psychology. Don't be lazy in learning. Learning is the beginning of freedom. Don't be a follower, be a student. Don't just read the easy stuff. If you do so, you'll not grow. Challange yourself with reading. **Skip the trash.** Not enough time to read the brilliant stuff.

> Let your library show that you are a serious student


# Keep a jounal
If you are serious about being wealthy, powerful, healthy. cultured, unique, keep a journal. If you listen to something valuable, write it down. If you come across something important, write it down. 
> Don't trust your memory.

Journal is a good portion of a journal. It is a good tresure to leave behind.
3 things or tresures to leave behind.
- Take a lot of pictures.
- Your library: The books, the ideas, that helps you to develop your philosophies, wealth, power, that helps you to conquer the poverty. What helped you to feed your mind and what helped you to feed your soul. Library is a stepping stone for getting out of dark into light.
- Your Journal: The ideas that you pick up, what you learnt doing different things so that you can go over it again and again.  Repetition is the mother of success.

You can get only a few answers from the outside. The rest of all magic answers are confined within your mind.

# Develop These 5 Abilities

## The ability to absorb
Be like a sponge. Don't miss anything. Absorb everything that you can.
> Most people are trying to get through the day. Learn to get from the day. Let the days teach you. 

Wherever you are, be there to absorb it. Let your soul and heart absorb it.

## Learn to respond
Let happy things make you happy. Let sad things make you sad.
Let the emotions strike you. Our emotions need to as educated as our intellect. 
Observe and respond. 

## The ability to reflect
Reflect means to go back over the notes and everything. Go back over your day. 
Here are some of the best times to reflect:
- Take a few minutes at the end of the day to go back over your day.
- Take a few hours at the end of the week: Go back over you calendar. Where did you go? What did you see? Whom did you meet? What did you feel? Capture that week.
- Take half a day at the end of the month to reflect. Go back over every important thing you did in the month
- Take a weekend at the end of the year to establish this year in your consciousness. Go back over and remember. It's so valuable to remember.


## The ability to take action
Don't lose much time. When the idea is hot and emotion is strong, it's the exact time to act. Take immediate action, as soon as possible. If you don't take action, the wisdom is wasted, the emotion soon passes. 
All disciplines affects each other. Everything affects everything else. Nothing stands alone. Everything matters.
Every new discipline affects the rest. Take the smallest action. It will inspire you take the next one, and the next one and the next one. 
The greatest value of discipline is self-worth and self-esteem. 
The problem with least neglection
Neglect starts as an infection and if you don't take care of it, it becomes a disease. One neglect leads to another and worst of all, it diminishes our value.

If you want to increase your self-worth, start with the smallest action that matches your philosophy.
Everyone have the access to the wisdom to be wealthier, powerful, happy, healthy and content with life. But they won't. Why? Well, we don't know.

Even though something is so simple and easy to do. Most will not do and a very few will do. If we go in numbers, 10% will do and 90% don't or won't. Even if you go 10 years ahead, the numbers will be the same. Only faces will change.
> Some do and some don't.

Walk away from the 97%. Don't talk like they talk. Don't act like they act. Don't go where they go. Throw away the blame list and start a new life.

Being able to do 50 pushups seems impossible for some people. But how do you actually go from 5 to 50 pushups. Isn't that a miracle to be able to do 50 pushups when you once couldn't even do 5?

How to get a miracle going?
- Do what you can
- Do the best you can
- Rest, very little. Don't rest too long. Make rest a necessity, not objective

## Develop the ability to share
If you picked up a good idea, pass it along. If you get a book and it really affected you, pass it along. Here's a good thing with sharing, if you share with 10 different people, they get to hear 1 time, but you get to hear 10 times. So, it will probably do more for you than them. Sharing is winning for everyone.

Can you fill a glass of water which is full? Yes, you can but you will first have to pour out what's already inside. If you are full of ideas, then pour it out so that you can fill it again with new ideas. But unlike glass, if you pour out, you become bigger. 

You don't lack capacity. If you share, you increase your capacity. Learn to share.

# Goals
Goals are your vision of the future. There are two ways to view the future: One with apprehension and two, with anticipation. 

> If you don't have plans of your own, you'll probably fall under somebody else's plan. 

Goals are the promises that you keep to yourself. If you can design your future, it can have an awesome effect on your future.

The price is easy if the promise is clear. The price of few simple disciplines practiced everyday will help you keep your promise. 

Decide what you want and write it down. Make a list of everything that you want to do, places you want to go. It can be anything. After all, its your list.


> Set a goal to become a millionaire. Why? For what it will make of you to achieve it.

What's important is not the money, what's important is the kind of person you become. Set the kind of goal that will make something of you to achieve them.

The greatest value in life is not what you get. The greatest value in life is what you become. That's what makes you valuable.

1. Don't set your goals too low: If you join an easy crowd, you can't grow. If you don't need much, you don't need to become much
2. Don't compromise, don't sell out: Don't compromise you values, virtues. Be aware.

# Financial Independence
Never spend more than 70 cents out of one dollar. Here's what you can do with the rest of the money: 
- **10% to charity:** Nothing teaches responsibility and character than generosity. The time to start this is when the amounts are small. 
- **10 % active capital:** Try your best to show profits. Touch something and leave it better than you found it. Become profit minded. Profits are better than wagers. Profits have the potential to make fortune.
- **10% Passive Capital:** The borrower is a servent to the lender. Let somebody else use your capital and earn interest or profit. 

It's not the amount that counts. It's the plan that counts. You can start at 97/1/1. You can rearrange and make it suit for yourself. These numbers can change as you progress. 

## keep strict accounts
Track your income and expenses. Track where your money goes and manage it properly.
## A new attitude
Taxes are how you feed the goose that lays golden eggs. Somebody may say the goose eats too much. But as a matter of act, we all eat too much. 

Reduce your liabilities and increase the assests. This will make you happy to pay the bills. 

> It's not the amount. Its what it represents of your life.

Think and come up with your own economic philosophy.

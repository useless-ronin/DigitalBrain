- Listening to same music over and over  can fuel your creative output
- Its not about sitting in quiet places and telling everyone to go out of your sight
- Melodic music if played on repat can increase the emotional height as well as increasing the awareness of your surrounding
- It puts you in the creative zone
- You can listen songs like normal people in this state
- Repeating the same songs again and again makes them fade into themselves.
- After you listen to a song enough, it becomes a perpetual chorus.
- Time stops. Distraction stops. Extraneous thinking stops. *All that's left is the work at hand* All thats left is what you are doing at hand. The problem you are trying to solve.
- Creative work is not always fun. Its about reaching deep inside yourself- that the society and environment around you  makes extremely difficult to achieve
- Every creative worker has to find their way. This might work for you or might not. But if it works, it works wonders




I pull down the blinds. I put my headset on and play the same soundtrack of twenty songs over and over and I don’t hear them. It shuts everything else out. So I don’t hear myself as I’m writing and laughing and talking to myself. I’m not even aware I’m making noise. I’m having a physical reaction to a very engaging experience. It is not a detached process.- Michael Lewis

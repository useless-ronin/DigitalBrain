It's normal to be stuck and not having the feeling to write when you have been consistently writing and are tired of the work. 

But if you are just starting, you have to build a habit of consistently writing before even thinking about taking a break.

Writing is simple. You just take out your laptop, find somewhere to sit, adopt the correct writer's mindset and you begin writing.

For professional writers, this process happens so smooth that the writer is not consciously aware of its happening. But for beginners, this is the hardest process.  Here are a few tips to build a writing habit.

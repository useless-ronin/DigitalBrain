- The most powerful aspects of working on the web  is the **ability to build, scale and spread things exponentially**
- Most don't tap into this opportunity and end up operating in the linear toolset which is capable of having exponential growth
- Productizing yourself is the most effective strategy to use in the web.
- **Don't work linearly.** Tap into the exponential nature of the internet and making a better living.
- **Putting in the work:**
	- You have to produce the best work you can produce before you hit the publish button. If its not good enough, why are you wasting others time?
	- "If  know in the back of my mind that I haven't taken my work as far as I can logically take it- or if my work is not a reflection of the best abilities- then why am I publishing it?" - Jack Butcher

- **Jack butchers Formula(steal these):**
	- **Step 1: Put in the reps**
		- Before you the process or products you must first hone your abilities. Put in the hours and and hone your particular skillset. 
		- **It's not reaching 10,000 hours. It's achieving 10,000 iterations.** 
		- Don't engage in mindless repetition. hone your skills, find and correct errors, and seek out feedback from people who can help you improve. (create a system for receivign and implementing feedback that continually sharpens how you practice.)
	- **Step 2: Publish what you create and learn**
		- You have to have a proof of your work. Everything you publish helps to distinguish you from other creators. 
		- Few tactics:
			- Create a routine to stick to publishing
			- Plan your content in months in advance
			- Engage with audience
			- Decide what you'll create in advance. Writer's block is symptom of being unprepared. It;s easier to be productive when it;s finally time to put pen to paper.
	- **Step 3: Discover repeating process**
		- You have to automate your business. If you have same repeatable tasks, automate them with good systems and tools. 
		- Few tips:
			- Create email templates
				- Don't rewrite same message a thousand times. Copy and paste
			- Process documentation
				- Document your process and send it to everyone who wants it
			- Vet clients with copy
				- Make one core offering
			- Use forms
				- Don't use emails. Use forms instead.
	- **Step 4: Solve problems at scale**
		- Solve your client's problem without your involvement
		- Write a book
		- create a course
		- sell templates
		- Automate service with software

- **Building in public**
	- Feedback and iteration:
		- Experiment and try new ways or methods of doing your work. Take feedback and improve upon it.
	- **Build an audience**
		- Publish on a platform. Be consistent and interact with other content online. 
		- Take notes on what works and what doesn't. Double down on what works and leave the rest.
		- You can never build online without a little experimentation and consistent publishing
		- Tips:
			- Find your niche:
				- Don't be a generalist at first. Start by becoming a specialist. Nobody cares about your opinion about everything.
				- Experiment with different forms of content
					- Different people do well on different platforms. There are many plarforms where you can publish your work. 
					- Find the platform that resonates with you and stick to it.
					- Write, create graphics, post photos, create videos. You never know what will help you most until you try.
	- **Be consistent**
	- Your brand is you:
		- Personal brand shouldn't be about putting on a show or pretending to be someone who you aren't.
		- *The sum of your curiosilty, and the time you spent pursuing your curiosity, is your brand.*

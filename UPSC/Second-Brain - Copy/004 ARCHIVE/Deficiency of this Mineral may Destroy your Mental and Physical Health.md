- Engineers spend millions and millions for making ant-sesmic buildings.
- They can build rather normal buildings with less money but its not useful for the long-term.
- Just like the earthquakes, there are adversities that occur in life
- Today you can do whatever you want. You can eat whatever you want, watch whatever you want, You can do whatever you want. 
- But tomorrow is quite different
- If you build a normal life. If you spend your now seeking pleasures, you will be shattered by small adversities that come into your life
- You will be sick. You will be depressed. You will fall apart

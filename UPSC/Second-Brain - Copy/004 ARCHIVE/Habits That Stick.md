> “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”-Will Durant

You understand that you need to change in order to live a more fulfilling life. 

After you read this, take the smallest action:
- Don't just be a book worm. Be a massive action taker. Because result is more important than knowldege. Knowledge is power but without action its is pretty much worthless.
- Resist the urge to try forming more than one habit at a time. Focus on one habit at a time. Keep it simple.

Extraordinary people have extraordinary habits. The reason why you are where you are is because of your habits. What you did today and yesterday. 

If you don't want to be at the same place 10 years from now, you have to be brutally honest with yourself. Ask yourself, " If I keep doing what I'm doing today, will i achieve any of my goals?"

- Daily habits are not necessarily hard to do, but it's very easy not to do them at all. Its easy to come with excuses. You wait for tomorrow.
- Nothing is gonna change tomorrow. What you do today is what you are going to do tomorrow, the next week and the next year and so on.
- Believing that your future self will somehow be disciplined than your current self is a major trap. What you do today determines what you'll do tomorrow.


# Why are habits important?
Our brain is mostly run by our subconscious mind. It is a very efficient machine that hates wasting energy. 

It doesn't like change. It likes the things the way they are. That's why it takes significan effort to change your brains existing programing and its an uphill battle.

The quality of our habits determine the quality of life. You're only a few habits away from living a successful and a happy life.

- Habits are the return on investment of your willpower that has been strategically directed towards their formation.
- Once your brain accepts a new change, you will need little to no willpower to maintain it daily.
- If you apply focused willpower to specific task everyday, its only a matter of time before it becomes automatic.
# What are good habits

# How to get rid of bad habits
When you do something for long enough, it becomes closely related to your identity. And the first step to break these habits is to seriously question your identity.

Start questioning your identity every day and figure out who you are and who you want to be. 

## Be mindful of your habits
Self-awareness is one of the most powerful ways to get rid of bad habits and implement the positive ones. 

Be self-aware, take full responsibility and commit fully to your decision. 

Observe your the kind of emotions you feel before, during and after you engage in a bad habit. Examine the feeling.

Just being conscious of the felling you have and delaying the moment to start engaging can help you be better at resisting the urge to act on your emotions.

## Replace bad habits with better ones
Its more effective o replace bad habits with positive ones than simply trying to get rid of them. 

## Visualize the future cost of today's bad habits
Visualization is one of the most powerful tools we have at our help. Visualizing on daily basis can help you break and make habits.
You can visualize the negative impacts of the bad habit and the pain associated with it after a decade. 
You can also visualize the positive impacts of good habits and the reward associated with it after a decade.


## From Procrastination to action
"Procrastination is the bad habit of putting off until the day after tomorrow what should have been done the day before yesterday." - Napolean Hill
- It's a dream killer.
Here are a few ways to eliminate procrastination
- Eliminate distractions:
	- leave as little room for distractions as possible.
	- Identify the potential procrastination patterns. 
	- inefficient prioritizing is draining your time, nothing else
	- Use time-log
	- Plan your tasks in advance
	- Prepare the environment
	- Before you start working on your task, spend a minute visualizing yourself doing it.
	- Keep a piece of paper on hand to write something in case something pops up as you are working.
- Reduce friction associated with starting the task
	- Reduce the discomfort involved in the beginning of your task.
	- Use visualization to do this.
	- Don't let fear creep in. Make it okay to do it poorly. 

## How to implement habits that stick 

## You are the product of your environment
Reduce or eliminate any obstacle on your list. Minimize temptations from your environment.

## Surround yourself with the right people
You are the average of the five people you spend you r most time with.

## Write down your habit
- What you are commiting to?
- Why this habit matters to you?
- 
## Consistency over intensity
If your habit requires so much energy that you can’t sustain it long enough for it to become automatic and ingrained in your subconscious, you’ll be very unlikely to succeed in implementing it.

## Never skip twice
Unless the habit is a well-established part of your subconscious, skipping it twice in a row comes with major risks.

Skipping a new habit tells your brain that the habit isn't that important and its pretty insignificant.

## Identify Your High-Leverage Habits
You can change your habits strategically to maximize the amount of positive change you experience. You can start with a keystone habit.

One habit which automatically makes it easy to create positive changes in life.

## Setting up triggers
The best way to implement habits is to set up a trigger for a specific habit. Choosing a solid trigger; things that you do every day at the same time, such as brushing your teeths, having breakfast can make it easier.

Perform the habit right after the trigger because this makes it easier to remember.

Make a list of rock-solid triggers that you have in your life and choose the best trigger for your habit.

## Create a series of habit
Once you have a habit set up, you can join multiple habits to create a chain like form. You complete one, and then start the next.

A morning ritual and an evening ritual is a good example of a series of habits. Creating rituals is one of the most effective ways to stay consistent with habits.

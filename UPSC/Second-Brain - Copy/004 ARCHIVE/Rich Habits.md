Most unsuccessful people blame luck for all of their misfortune and think people who are living a better life are living it because they are just plain lucky. Although it is true that you need to be lucky to be rich, there are types of luck that you need to understand about:

There are 4 types of luck: "Random good luck" "random bad luck" "opportunity luck" and "detrimental luck".

Good luck and bad luck are two types of luck that you don't have any control over. For example: winning a lottery or being hit by a thunderstorm. they are not under your contro.

But opportunity luck and detrimental luck are the ones you can control. "opportunity luck" is the byproduct of your daily habits. If you continue working hard, then you will reap the results. This is opportunit luck. People who are successful are the ones who focus on the long-term in order to create opportunity luck to occur in their lives.


The fourth type of luck is detrimental luck. This type of luck will make you get you downhill on the road of success. They are the bad habits that create a devastating life in the future.

Break each goal into smaller task and prepare a to-do list and follow your to-do list religiously.

# They engage in self-improvement everyday

They moderate their work hours, eating habits, exercise, alcohol intake, watching television, reading, Internet use, phone conversations, emails, text messages, conversations, entertainment, sexual relations, and so on. Their personalities reflect this moderate mindset. They do not become overly excited or excessively melancholy. They are even-tempered, and slow to anger or excitement.
On the other hand, unsuccessful people live in extremes. They eat too much, drink too much, talk too much and overeact too much.

# They have "do it now" mindset

# They control their thoughts and emotions
Thoughts are the seeds you plant that will eventuall give you the fruits. Successful people are the master of their thoughts and feelings. They don't easily fall prey to angee, jealousy, sadness and other emotions. They "think, evaluate and react". THey are too busy to allow themselves in being sad or depressed.

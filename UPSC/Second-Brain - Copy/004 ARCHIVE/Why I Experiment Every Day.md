> Life is measured not by our good deeds, or by who loved us, or by what charities weâ€™ve done, but by the number of experiments we did.

- Everything is an experiment
- It helps you play with your comfort zone and learn more about the world.
- Learning to experiment with your life is like working on your muscle. The more you work, the better you get at it.

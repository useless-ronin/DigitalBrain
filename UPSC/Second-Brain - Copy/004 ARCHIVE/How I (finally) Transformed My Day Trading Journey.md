- There's a urge to find the next shiny strategy and new indicator that will make you profitable. But no such thing exists.

# Market First
- The context of the overall market is more important than your favorite stock
- First look at the market as a whole

# Supply and Demand
- Look for supply and demand zones to map out to guide you
- Work with a larger time frame and slowly come down to smaller time-frame

# Relative strength or weakness
- Relation between a stock and the whole market

# Sizing down
- Your enemy is you. Its a mental game
- Revenge trading, emotional trades
- Size down where you can take trades without involving your emotions
- Wait for a pullback instead of ***FOMO***
- You don't have to catch up every trade. There are other opportunities as well.

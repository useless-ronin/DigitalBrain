- People want to listen to the truth. Just share it and see how many people resonate with your story.
- Most of us do things that never scares us. We conform to the status-quo. James altucher said, "I don't do a post now unless I'm worried about what people will think about me."

Love yourself. Thats what everyone tells us. It is the same thing that most self-help books repeat over and over that it sounds cliche. 
- Just like meditation, or exercise, the act of self-love is also a practice.
> - Love yourself with the same intensity you would use to pull yourself if you were hanging off a cliff with your fingers. As your life depends on it.
- Loving yourself is the best thing that you can do for your body, mind and soul.
In the book, the author Kamal Ravikant writes that he was almost at a breaking point. He was done with the misery, pain and the angst of being himself. He then one day vowed to love himself. 'I love myself. I love myself. I love myself' He would always have this thing in his mind. After a long time of this act of 'self-love' his mind and body healed like never before. His life got better in ways he never expected.

- Our brain already has a strong wiring for love. It knows that love heals.
- Your job is to love yourself, truly and deeply. And as you love yourself, life loves you back.
- The simple practice of saying "I love myself" over and over again until its more on your head than not can create magic in your life.
- One thought has no power over you.  But if you repeat it again and again with emotional intensity, then it controls you.
- Take the thought of loving yourself and repeat it enough times to make it your truth.
- The more you think about it, the more you feel it, the stronger the memory.
- It will take time but you will notice changes, shifts in your feelings and beautiful things happening in your life.
> - Here we are, thinking that one needs to be in love with another to shine, to feel free and shout from the rooftops, but the most important person, the most important relationship we'll ever have is waiting, is craving to be loved truly and deeply.
- Loving yourself makes you shine naturally.
- Ask yourself, "If i loved myself, truly and deeply, what would you do?"
> - Commit to yourself. It's easy to wish for health when you're sick. When you're doing well, you need just as much vigilance.
> - The goal, if there is one, is to practice until the thought you chose becomes the primary loop.
> - I think that instead of reading loads of self-help books, attending various seminars, listening to different preachers, we should just pick one thing. Something that feels true for us. Then practice it fiercely.

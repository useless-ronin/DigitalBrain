Our world is filled with abundance not with scarcity anymore. Drugs, foods, gambling, gaming, texting, Instagram, youtube and many more. *The smartphone is the modern day needle devlivering us the high for new generation.* 

The more dopamine something releaseses, the more you want something, the more addictive it is. 

We have leaned overly to the pleasure side and if we don't bring back the balance of pleasure and pain, the future is going to look a lot worse. 

This book is about pleasure and pain. It helps us in understanding the relationship between pain and pleasure and help us find a healthier balance between the two.

## The Pursuit of Pleasure
Addiction is a compulsive and continued behaviour despite its self-harm. The biggest factor of getting addicted to something is its easy accesss. We are living in a dopamine driven economy.

Food is manipulated by adding artificial flavors to satisfy our modern appetite. Digital drugs that were not exisiting few years ago are in the hands of every person. 
Dopamine doesn't care about how you get to your desired goal. The art of consumption has become a drug itself. The internet promotse compulsive overconsumption. Humans are social and contagious. They do what they see others doing.

## Running From Pain
> People are afraid to fail. They are afraid of being exposed as not knowing. 

We are living in an age where even showing kindness and helping others is framed as a strategy for personal happiness. 

In the recent times, we have lost our ability to tolerate even minor forms of discomfort. We constantly seek to distract ourselves from the present moment, to be entertained. 

Boredom forces us t face bigger problems of life and question that seems threatening. That's why most people can't stand boredom. But it is often the opportunity for discovery and invention. 

We all are running from pain. Some use drugs to run away from it. Some binge-watch Netflix. Some engage in porn. We are doing almost anything to insulate from pain. But this is only making this worse. 

With so much technological advancement and progress why is the rate of unhappy and depressed people rising skyhigh.
> It's because we're working hard to avoid being miserable.

## The Plesure-pain Balance
Dopamine is a brain chemical involved in reward processing. It plays a role in motivation to get a reward.

A genetically engineerd mouse which was unable to release dopamine didn't seek food and starved to death. But when food was directly put it their mouth, they chew it. 

### Pleasure and pain are co-related
Pleasure and pain are processed in overlapping brain regions. Pain and pleasure are self-regulatory. When the balance tips off towards one side, the self-regulating mechanism comes into action to bring it back to same level. Like homestatis, maintaning equillibrium in the brain.
### Neuroadaptation
When you repeatedly expose yourself to similar pleasure stimulus, the pleasure side gets weaker and pain sides get stronger. Scientists call this neuroadaptation. 

The reason why people relapse even after sustained periods of abstinence is the pain-pleasure balance When balance is tilted to pleasure side for a long time, we crave the pleasure just to feel normal. But if we wait long enough, the brain will readapt to the baseline. 

The pursuit for pleasure for its own sake leads the inability to enjoy pleasure of any kind.

Dopamine deficiet state drives craving and seeking out for reward. Addiction can be measured by how hard one is willing to work to obtain that drug.

### The balance is only a metaphor
Pleasure for one person might be pain for the other. Sometimes pain and pleasure can occur simultaneously like when eating spicy food. 

Prolonged and repeated exposure to pleasure reduces our capacity to tolerate pain and increases our threshold for experiencing pleasure increases.

Our brains evolved in the world of scarcity. If there was no pleasure, we wouldn't eat, drink and reproduce. If there was no pin, we wouldn't protect ourselves from injury and death. 

But the modern world is filled with abundance. We have not evolved for this world. So how do we survive in this new ecosystem of dopamine driven economy.

## Dopamine Fasting
You can reset your reward pathway. It can take anywhere between four weeks to a few months. The stronger your addiction, the more time you'll need. 
Stop running from the painful stimulus and instead tolerate them. 

## Space, Time, And Meaning
Waiting till we feel the compulsion to engage in a behaviour will nearly impossible to resist. Therefore we should create a barrier between ourselves and our drug. We add friction between desire and action. 
Slef binding is necessity in the modern world. 
- Physical self-binding: Creating physical and geographical barriers 
- Chronological self-binding: Restricting to consumption only certain times of day, month, or year. Limits our use. 
- Categorical self-binding: It limits consumption by sorting dopamine into different cateogires.

## A Broken Balance
Most of use drugs to cure our addiction. But there is an alternative path that might work as well, embracing pain. 

## The Pursuit of Pain
Pressing on the pain side can often lead to pleasure. The dopamine that comes from pain is indirect and potentially more enduring. 

Pain leads to pleasure through body's own homeostatic mechanisms. Intermittent exposure to pain makes us less vulnerable to pain and more able to feel pleasure over time.

Just like pain is the price way pay for pleasure, pleasure is the reward we get for pain. 

Take for an example, exercise. It is immediately harmful to cells. It increases body temperature, and deprive your body of oxygen and glucose. Yet, evidence whos that exercise is the best remedy for modern world. While lack of exercise for a long time is deadly. 

We have evolved to walks 10s of kilometer in search of food. A key to well-being is to get off the couch and get moving.

Remember that you'll feel pleasure after pain. Pursuing pain is countercultural in the modern world. But it is the way.

### Pain to Treat Pain
> “ Of two pains occurring together, not in the same part of the body, the stronger weakens the other.”

Electricity is applied to the brain to treat mental illness.

> "What doesn't kill makes a man stronger"- Friedrich Nietzche

Use pain to treat pain. Anxiety to treate anxiety. 

Just as we become tolerant to pleasure stimuli. With repeated exposure, the pain becomes normal. Too much pain can also run the risk of compulsive consumption. But the right amount can create joy in your life
### Radical Honesty
Telling truths can improve our llives. We are wired to lie from the earliest age. No matter who you are, we all do it. 

Deception is used as a weapon as well as a shield. Lies can help when you are competing for scarce resources. 

Truth telling engenders a abundance mindset. Honesty can be an antidote ot a false self. When we are no longer working as a false self, we're more open to ourselves and others. 

Also, lying is never worth the onsequences.


## Lessons on Balance
We are all drawn to the pleasurable forms of escape. We engae in addictive drugs and behaviours that will only add more problems in our life in the future. Instead of running away from life, you should find a way to immerse yourself fully in the life. 

Today's action that seem to hav eno impact in the present moment are in fact taking you in the right direction.

We have more leisure time than ever before. Leisure time ensures boredom. 

In today's dopamine driven world, we have been intolerant to delayed gratification. We want everything here and now. The easy-acces dopamine doesn't require you to get off the couch.  We all are being primed for seeking immediate gratification. And it is the sure shot way to move towards destruction.

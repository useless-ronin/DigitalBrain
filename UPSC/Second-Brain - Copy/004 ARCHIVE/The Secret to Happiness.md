We need to stop attaching conditions for happiness. People want to feel happy only as long as certain conditions, like success wealth, safety, etc. are met.
 
But happiness is not waiting for you on the other side of the new job, degree, or across the country. Happiness is always waiting for you to claim it.

Most of us hand  on to our desires or expectations, and that's the biggest threat to happiness.

We can absolutely wish for things, be thankful when scary things donâ€™t happen, be sad when things do, and be happy when things go a certain way.

Happiness is achieved no matter what.

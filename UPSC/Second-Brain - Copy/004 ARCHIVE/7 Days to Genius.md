7 Days To Genius Ideas Challenge

-   If you are interested in taking advantage of the digital economy boom (no, **you don't need to be an "expert" in anything**),

-   Step 1) Topic
    
-   Step 2) Braindump
    
-   Write out everything that comes to mind when you read the idea.
    
-   Write a brief summary of the topic in a way that YOU understand at this point in your life.
    
-   Step 3) References
    
-   Paste a link to it under the references section.
    
-   Where did you get this idea from? Is it from a quote? Tweet? Article?
    
-   **being able to back up your argument is important for credibility**. And people just love seeing quotes and tweets in your articles or newsletters.
    
-   Step 4) **The Big Problem**
    
-   Is there anythin*g worth more than solving the* problems that people experience on a daily basis?
    
-   For the big problem — **think back to experiences you've had, others have had, or that is talked about often.** You can research more articles on the topic to **see what common problems people are talking about.**
    
-   This will start to wire your brain for entrepreneurship. **You get paid in proportion to the problems you solve.**
    
-   Why The Big Problem?
    
-   Marketing, persuasion, influence, attention, and anything else all starts with a problem. This is the start of impacting human behavior.
    
-   Step 5) The Big Benefit
    
-   What is the **big benefit to overcoming this problem**?
    
-   People are selfish, you included.
    
-   people are ALWAYS searching for **"What's in it for me?"**
    
-   Why The Big Benefit?
    
-  **Transformations.** That's what people want. That is the foundation of marketing, sales, attention, persuasion, writing, speaking, and impact.
    
-   **Point A is where they are now (the problem).**

-   **Point B is where you help them get (the benefit).**
    
-   Step 6) Objections
    
-   Do you have limiting beliefs when overcoming this problem?
    
-   What are common excuses you hear regarding this topic?
    
-   The only reason people don't solve their own problems is because they talk themselves out of it. Same goes for you.
    
-   Handling objections is how you build self-awareness and how you make people more aware of their problems. This is ultimately what changes human behavior.

# Good Idea
    

-   For most people, the journey stops here.
    
-   They let their notes, thoughts, and ideas sit on their virtual bookshelf to collect dust and cause worry.
    
-   This is why it is important to make this a part of your routine.
    
-   So you are consistently riding the dopamine wave of idea generation and pattern recognition.
    
-   **Action follows inspiration** — so schedule inspiration into your routine.
    
-   Turning These Into Good Ideas
    
-   This is where things start to get juicy and ideas start to fly.
    
-   This process is replicable and will form the foundation of an impactful and persuasive Genius Idea.
    
-   Step 7) Personal Experience
    
-   **Do you have experience overcoming the problem?**
    
-   How did you do it?
    
-   What was it like?
    
-   **Humans want to connect with other humans**. Humans make sense of the world via concepts and symbols.
    
-   Stories are a series of concepts and symbols with a dash of emotion.
    
-   Step 8) **Frameworks**
    
-   **Can you create a step-by-step way for people to overcome the problem?**
    
-   How would you overcome the problem if you were faced with it again?
    
-   Can you **slap a compelling name on it and make it your own**? (So people can remember it and tie it back to you?)
    
-   Point A is the problem and Point B is the benefit to the transformation...
    
-   Your framework is a unique, step-by-step way for helping them get there. That is what books, coaching, courses, and content are.

-   **The teacher learns more than the student.**
    
-   Here are some questions to help the process:
    
-   Craft Your Big Idea
    
-   If you were to **try and summarize everything you wrote in one sentence**, how would you write it?
    
-   What is the big **idea behind the transformation**? (Why should people care?)
    
-   Can you **reduce the perceived effort of acquiring that transformation**?
    
-   Can you **exaggerate the problem so much that it seems stupid not to solve it**?
    
-   Here is how you can start to prime your brain to think in "big ideas:"
    
-   **Read headlines everyday.**
    
-   **Read more books and try to dissect the big ideas.**
    
-   Read landing pages and sales pages.
    
-   Follow more people that are trying to help people on social media (ditch the self-deprecating memes).
    
-   Write out your big idea in the space that says "Big Idea Goes Here" in the Notion hub.
    
-   You can categorize by topic in Notion, or add tags to the actual big idea (and change the color of the text so it stands out).

-   If you want to be a commodity in the modern world, become a specialist.
    
-   **If you want to be irreplaceable in the modern world, become a jack of all trades.**
    
-   **Genius Ideas are found at the intersections of your curiosities.**
    
-   This is where passion is born (it's actual science).
    
-   You quite literally won't be able to shut up about what you are learning.
    
-   **Genius ideas can't be written.**
    
-   **They are found in the intersections of all of your big, original ideas.**

-   If you have done this for a few days — **do you feel the urge to share your learnings with other people?**
    
-   No? Then **it may be time to learn about things that actually cause excitement in you.**
    
-   If you do feel the urge:
    
-   -  Start writing tweets
        
    -   Start writing articles
        
    -   Start outlining podcast episodes
        
    -   Start outlining YouTube videos
        
    -   **you don't have to be a credentialed expert.**
        
    -   **you don't need some fancy process. You need practice. (And consistency)**
        
    -   Teaching about the subject will help you enjoy it more — and turn it into a future source of income.
        
    -   **Creating Is About Saying 1 Thing 1000 Different Ways (And Doubling Down On What Sticks)**
        
    -   Everyone has the same problems.
        
    -   The "how" (how you would solve that problem) is already out there.
        
    -   The "why" is what gets the sale (and attention — the new currency).
        
    -   The pain, benefit, story, big idea, emotion, and broadening awareness.
        
    -   Your Genius Ideas are how you do that.
        
    -   A novel perspective that raises dopamine levels in the reader is how you do that.
        
    -   "Life Force 8
        
    -   One last thing on "saying 1 thing 1000 different ways:"
        
    -   **Talking about the same idea for weeks on end is not bad. It is very very good.**
        
    -   **Attack it from all angles. Raise your readers awareness on the topic.** Bring them to your level of understanding (which will result in you needing to gain a deeper understanding).
        
    -   All of this creative work and business stuff is just self-improvement in disguise.

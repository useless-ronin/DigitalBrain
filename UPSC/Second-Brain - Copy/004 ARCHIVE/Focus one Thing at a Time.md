- If you have two many things doing in the same category, avoid them
- Focus on one thing in one category only.
- Take this in approach in every area of your life, you will change your life
- You spend a lot of time in areas that you shouldn't
- If you stop being committed to everything, you will be more happy
- Do one thing only. It gives you extreme focus
- And that's how you achieve results that look impossible

Not focusing on multiple things at once helps you to avoid overwhelm.
- Overwhelm is the enemy of passion and energy. It will drain you out.

Embrace the power of doing nothing.

[[Focus on a Single Thing & see how your life changes]]

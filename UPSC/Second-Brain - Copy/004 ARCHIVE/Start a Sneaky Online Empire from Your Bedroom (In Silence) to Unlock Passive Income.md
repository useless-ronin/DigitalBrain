- Having internet connection makes you powerful
- Use it to go forward in life not backwards. 
- We all start out that way but anyone start a passive income machine from their bedroom.
- Side-hustle starts with a feeling. A feeling that's insie you and says quietly that you're meant for more.
- We all have this feeling throughout our life. But most of us don't act on it.
- Take tiny action and begin your journey. Action so small that it doesn't even feel like progress.
- There are endless options on where to start: books, websites, ecommerce, newsletter and many more.
- But whatever you do, you need to love it. 
- Choose something that you could do forever even if you get paid only a little
- To find the right side-hustle for you: try many things.
- **Act with courage**
	- Do it in silence. tell no one. People are likely to throw you off your game. 
- It sounds easy at the start but it is not. It requrres courage to write with vulnerability. courage to give up your time to pursue a side-hustle instead of netflix.
- **You'll feel stupid and alone. Everyone starts this way. Its a sign, not to give up. keep going**
- Be curious: 
	- Its the skill that will help you find your way
- Don't prepare, start
	- "99% of learning happnes after launching"
	- Preparation is your enemy.
	- By the time you have prepared, the market has moved
	- Algorithm changed
	- Googles seo pivoted
	- Blogs are disrupted by substack
	- Every minute, change is coming. Think like a runway train. Get your skinny ass on the train. Answers will appear once you take action./
	- **The dirty little secret:**
		- We have no idea what we're doing when we start. We are taught to research and seek permission But life not so much.
		- Give yourself permsiion. There are no rules
		- Take action. Throw in some punches. Ignore the critics. They are the crowd who never take action.

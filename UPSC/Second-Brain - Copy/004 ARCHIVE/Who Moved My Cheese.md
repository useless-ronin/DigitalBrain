Who moved my cheese by spencer Johnson is a grea book about how to handle change in our personal lives and professional lives. It takes less than an hour to read but gives insights that can last for a lifetime.

In this book, cheese is a metaphor used by the author for what you want in life. Maybe it is a good job, relationship of health, whatever it many be. The story of who moved my cheese shows you how you can anticipate, adapt and enjoy the changes. It might even help you to change and be better.

Here are some important lessons that you can learn from this book:
- [[Change is inevitable]]:
	- The world is constantly changing and with the improvement in technology it's even faster. Most people are afraid to change. People often ask,"Why should I change?" They have the feeling of superiority. They often resist change because they are afraid to change. They are comfortable where they are and they don't want to leave that place. 
	- Human belief systems hold them from doing what they should be doing. They are fearful. They are afraid of the unknown. Fear is good sometimes. But if you are so afraid that it keeps you from doing anything, it's not good. Most of the human fears are irrational and keep you from changing when you need to. You have to take action. You have to ask yourself the question, "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
- [[Start taking action]]
	- When you start taking action instead of thinking and worrying about the situation, you move in a new direction. You ge tout of your comfort zone and slowly start to adapt to change. It slowly starts to make change easier. You take control of the situation rather than simply letting things happen to you. As change slowly becomes easier, you stop being afraid. You start feeling good.
- The sooner you start change, the better
	- It is human tendency to hold on to things longer than they should. Because it feels so good and comfortable. We expect different results doing the same things, and being in the same situations. Some people are so afraid of change that they don't even want to start looking. The fear that you build up in your head is worse than the situation that's outside. But the people who have changed realize how late they were to change. They realize that the sooner they had started lookind for change, the sooner they'd have found it.
- Old beliefs don't lead to new cheese
	- When you change what you believe, you change what you do. If you believe, change will harm you, you resist it. If you believe change will bring something good, you embrace it. It all depends on what you choose to believe.

# Change yourself.

If you want to change your future, you have to change. If you don't change, your next 5 years will be the same as the previous five years. 

If you change, everything will change for you. If you'll get better, everything will change for you. Remarkable things will happen once you start changing.

You have to stop thinking and waiting for the external environment to change. Stop waiting for the government to change. Stop wishing for your boss to change. Stop hoping circumstance to get better. They will continue the same. In fact some of them will even get worsen.

The wind is gonna always blow however it turns out. What you need to wish for is not the good wind, rather the wisdom, knowledge, skills that helps you to sail better. 

Three subjects: Personal development, setting goals, how to become financially independent

# Personal Development
Here is a simple economics: You get paid for the value you bring to the market, not for the time. If you are not much valuable to the market, you don't make much money. If you say, it shouldn't be that way, you'll have to start your own country.

It's possible for you to be a man of high value no matter where you start or where you begin. 

The way to be valuable is to work hard on yourself than you do on your work.

# Setting goals
We need to take a look into the future. 
- Don't use past as a burden. Let it teach you. 
- The future is called promise. People view future in two ways: apprehension, and anticipation. Most people haven't designed what they want to be in the future. The best way to face the future is with anticipation. If you have clarity about future.
- **Setting goals**
	- Decide what you want
	- What do you want to do? where you want to go? What do you want to feel?
	- Write it down. Keep the list.
	- As you accomplish the goal, check it off. checking your goals is a game you play.
- To achieve goals, you gotta pay the price.
- If the promise is clear and powerful, the price is easy to pay.
- The major reason for setting goals is what they make of you in achieving them
- Set the kinds of goals that will make something of you

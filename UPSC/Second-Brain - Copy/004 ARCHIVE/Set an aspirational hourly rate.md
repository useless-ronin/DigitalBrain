- Value your time, for no one else is going to value you more than you value yourself.
- Have an high personal hourly rate and stick to it.
- Factor your time into every decision.
- If you want to get in the path of wealth creation and getting rich, you hav to make it your #1 priority. You can't have something else before it. You have to make it your overwhelming priority.
- Before you make a decision to invest your time in something, ask yourself, **if it's worth throwing away your hourly inspirational rate.**
- Use your time to do little stuffs or use it to do the big stuffs. 
- ***great scientists were terrible at managing their home lives. None of them had an organized room, or made social events on time, or sent their thank-you cards.***
- Spend your life however you want but you can't penny pinch your way to wealth.
- Don't do something that you don't do. Rather hire someone or outsource what you don't have to do.
- If you can outsource for less than your hourly rate, do it.
- Set your hourly rate absurdly high. If it doesn't seem absurdly high, it's not high enough.

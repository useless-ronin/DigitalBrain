			- Hey {{ first_name }},
			- Just want to be upfront, so I don’t waste your time because I value you [second half is my addition]
			- I don’t do non-transactional meetings. I don’t do meetings without a strict agenda. I don’t do meetings unless we absolutely have to.- {Pax}
		- How to say no on principle — Tim Ferriss
			- John, thanks so much for reaching out and apologies for my delayed response.
			- I have been trying to do too much of late, which makes it hard to keep up with correspondence. I also have to admit I am not good at saying no, because I enjoy meeting people and discussing new ideas.
			- Unfortunately, the truth is that I am maxed out and need to take a step back.
			- Over the next few months, I will not be taking any new calls or meetings outside of my existing commitments to my business, family and myself. This will give me the energy and time I need to complete some big projects (such as finishing my second book) and be more successful in reaching my most important goals.
			-  This is my blanket policy until I am caught up.
			- Thanks in advance for your understanding.
		- How to say no to a written interview — James Clear
			- Hi Pat,
			- First, thank you so much for thinking of me for this opportunity! Unfortunately, my calendar is completely full right now so I’m not going to be able to do this.
			- I can offer my work as an alternative. You are welcome to share quotes from Atomic Habits or my articles with your audience. I know this isn’t quite what you were hoping for, but I’d like to think that this work will be useful to your audience all the same.
			- I’m sorry I don’t have better news. Thank you for understanding and I wish you continued success.
		- How to say no to a phone call (keep things over email/DM) — Paul Graham
			- Hey {{ first_name }},
			- What do you want to talk about?
		- How I say no to podcasts
			- Hi,
			-  It means a lot that you would ask and thanks for supporting my work.
			- Unfortunately, the only format I do is written form. I’m not a great speaker so I stick to my strengths.
			- Happy to recommend other guests that may be better suited.

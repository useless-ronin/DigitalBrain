Written by tabitha brown, this books is filled with affirmations and inspirations on how to live your life with abundance of joy, peace of mind, and freedom. This book will inspire you to be your best self. This book will help you find the light and help people find their way.

It's a powerful thing to rise out of the depths of darkness. It might not end tomorrow or even the next day, but life will not always be hard.

Whenever you look at someone's life you are only seeing the fruit. You don't see the roots. you have to remember that you don't eat the fruits the same day you plant seeds.

When you ask for something in life, don't be vauge. Specify the details. You have to be careful of what you aks, you might actually get it. Don't pray for more that what you are ready to receive. 

Your life is your business. If you are busy minding everybody else's business, you'll eventually get out of business. Focus o n your own life, don't look for pleasing others.

Do whatever pleases you. Put yourself first. 

## We are all gifted. Find it.
We are all born with gifts, talents, and abilities in order to use them, not to let the stay dormant inside of us. Not to carry them to our grave. There are many people who leave this place without ever letting their brilliance see the light. You don't have to be one of them.

Sometimes your gifts may be unique, something others think is strange. But don't let the voices of other peneterate into your soul. Embrace your gifts because you are chosen. If you don't use your gifts and are scared of what people will think of you, you'll lose you gifts. And losing your gift will also mean losing the purpose attached with it. 

If you keep going and keep believing, your dreams will come true eventuallyy.

## You have to work on your dreams
Many of us pray to god for healing but we are still eating the same things that makes us sick. If you don't take ownership of your life, you are not gonna reach anywhere.

God will help you but only if you are doing your part. He is always looking for commitment and investment in the things that you are called to do. 

Just because you believe in your dreams, they will not come true., you have to be willing to go out and do it. You have to stop looking over your past and start moving towards your future.

You should stop letting someone else drive the car of your life. Pull the keys back and take control of your life. Make yourself the only driver.

## Everyone can't go
Not everyone you want will be there with you in your journey. You've to be okay with that. Some people don't even want to move their body for their own self. How can you expect them to be there in your journy. 

Just because you don't have someone with you doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice your goals. You have to be willing to walk alone. That's what will make something of you.

You have to stop depending on others and place a bet on yourself to make something out of you.

We come alone and go alone. This means that there are times when we are called upon to walk our paths alone. This walk can be scary but it will totally be worth it. 

You don't have to be upset when others don't understand your goals or what you are trying to do. They don't get it because that's not their dream. They don't get it because god didn't choose them. He chosed you. And it's your job to go after your dream not your friends, or families.

We must remind ourself constantly that not everybody is equipped to come along on our journey. Choose the right people and at the right time. Don't be upset just because you have to travel the road alone.

## Changing your mind is okay
Just because something was one way doesn't mean it has to stay the same way. Sometimes there's a need to change. You can change your mind. you can live your by your own standards and define yourself for yourself.

Traditions are wonderful but you shouldn't hold on to out of fear of the unknown or when they are imposed. It's okay to refuse them when they are no longer serving us. 

You have to stop trying to fit in and trying to conforming to the status quo to make others people feel comfortable. This is not freedom in any way. 

## Stop living by others prescription
Your vision is your not theirs. So stop being upset about what others think. They think so because they can't see what you see. Don't waste your time trying to force people to see your vision. Instead invest your energy in manifeasting your vision.

Sometimes people who are dearest to you will not understand you or support you. But that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't love you. You can speak out your vision loud to some people so that they can validate, that you had a vision.

Your vision is only for you. Others won't see it. And its perfectly alright. Keep on working on your dreams and stop being upset about what the non-believers say.

## Put yourself first
> “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence. It is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.”- Audre Lorde

This is easier said than done, but it is what it is. You can't please everybody and if you try to, you will end up being miserable.  

if you want to do something for you. go right ahead. Do it because you deserve it. You don't have to feel guilty about it. It's not about being selfish. It's self love. And it's the most rewarding thing you'll ever do.


## Forgive people
Forgiving doesn't mean you have to be cool with that person. It's for you, for your freedom. It has nothing to do with that person or what he did. 

Forgiving people lets you live the most amazing life by letting go of what you are holding in your heart. Stop holding on to that thing, whatever it is. Confront it, so that you can grab a hold of all that's coming.

> If someone hurt you, you not only owe yourself respect, but also owe the respect of telling them how you feel. Don't worry abot what they might say or feel or how they respond. You did your part. The rest is spirit's work to do.

The best way to free yourself from that burden it to open your mouth. Open your mouth and tell the truth.

God gave us heart to love. And part of loving ourselves means to be willing to forgive and be forgiven.

## It's going to happen
Even when you want a baby, it takes nine month of incubation and nurturing. You can't just leave that baby alone in this world. That's exactly true for your dreams. 

You have to nurture your dream. It's easy to post motivational and inspirational quotes from the comfort of your couch. If all you do is sit back on the couch, eat chips and look at what everyone's doing scrolling through your phone, it ain't gonna work like that.

You have to learn the craft and build skills that are necessary to make your dreams a reality. You have to stop letting the negative voices enter your head.

You will find people who will not always like you. They will discourage you. There will be circumstances where you won't feel like doing your work. If you let that discouragement get inside your head, it will make you mentally sick and spread like a disease.

The bigger your dream. the bigger will be the moments when things don't go right. Just breathe a few times and be aware of those situations.

> It's okay to be discouraged. It's natural. But in the discouragement, find your courage. Find the courage to keep going.

## Stop running 
If you want to live the most amazing life, you have to face the things that prevent you from having it. It's the only way to go through it. 

Most people run from their problems. They run because of fear, depression, anger or confusion. You can't react the same way these people. You can't run from it. You probably will feel uncomfortable but that's what you will face before your life turns around.

## Stop complaining and condemning
> “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence. It is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” - Shirley Chishom

Nothing will give you results except for showing up and doing the right thing. Things that you are afraid to od. Things that you don't enjoy. Life is more easier when it is lived rather than thinking about all the things that can happen and stressing over it.

Some people love to blame everyone and anyone they can. And of course, its easier to blame someone, right? It's easier to point the ginger at everyone except ourselves.

You can never get ahead by sitting on the sidelines and complaining about it. You have to force yourself to start and learn what you want to do. Stop runnig away from things.

## Tell the truth
Open your mouth and tell your story honestly. You never no whose life you will change by having the courage to tell the truth.

Your secrets make you sick. They have the ability to fester into tumors, cancers, panic attacks, anxiety and all types of aiments in the body. If you always keep the secrets inside you, they'll only grow.

When you tell the truth, you fell better and you don't have to constantly live in the fear of being exposed.

## Spread Love
Many of us like to talk against people who are not like us. People are hated just because of who they are, and for being the way the god created them. Just because someone doesn't look like you doesn't make them wrong.

Just because someone doesn't believe the same things that you believe doesn't mean you can hate on them. Turning your back on someone is not an action rooted in love. 

Before you treat someone harshly, put yourself in that person's shoes. Then ask  youself," How does that make you feel?"

No one was born to hate. We all have been taught or had some bad experiences that made us to react that way. 

Stop being too quick to judgeothers. Be kins to people who are different fromm you.

##  You are enough
Here's the truth:
> Not everybody is gonna like you. Not everybody is gonna love you or support you. And you have to be okay with that.

Sometimes we shed some people naturally from our lives and that's just a part of our life. If you ar e having second or third thoughts about someone, it's probably good to not have a fourth one. Let them be on their way. 

> If your circle doesn't serve you or doesn't make you better, you ain't in a circle- you're in a cage.

Choose to be yourself no matter if someone likes it or not. You are already enough. Don't confront yourself to fit the picture of what other people have painted for you.  Stop chaining yourself to other people's expectation in order to make them feel comfortable.

Stop hiding things that makes you unique. 

> In a world where we could be anything, the best thing to be is yourself.

You are an original creation and there's nothing better than originality. Don't allow others to influence who you are.

## Don't stress over small things
Stop worrying over the things that you have no control over. Don't waste your time on things that aren't serving you. It's okay to  remove from a unfulfilling circle. Every person has a purpose in our lives. Not all are meant to stay forever. 

Things can change quickly once you learn to embrace them and let other stuff go. You're more likely to find yourself in places and donig things you could have never imagined before.

If you are stressing about the little things, ask yourself questions

## You are alive today for a reason
It doesn't matter how old or young a person is. When they leave this earth, its because their work is don. If you woke up today, its because you still have work to do. You are still here and what are you going to do with that?

You don't have tomorrow. Forget tomorrow, even the next minute is not promised. 

## There's more than one path to success
Just because someone did one way doesn't mean you have to follow the same path. There are multiple paths leading to the same path and you can choose a different one. You don't have to do everything the same way.

In fact, you might create a new blueprint in your field or family. You'll never know this until you keep trying to do it the same way everybody has done it in the past.

Don't be scared to do it differently. Create a new path and a new way because that's where freedom is.

## Never forget to be grateful
It's easy to forget where you came from. It's easy to lose the sight. But you should never let the memory of the distance you have travelled. You shoul be deeply rooted in humility. 

The attitude of gratitude helps you to live a happy life. Stand in gratitude. Find something to be grateful for  and your heart's posture will elevate you.

## You're alright
Don't let your situations determine how you will live your life forever. Say to yourself," This is temporary. I'm gonna get through this."

You are always young and vibrant. Don't let the external enviroment say something else. Our bodies were created to age and grow but not us. Work not just on the outside but also in the inside. Because that's what makes you beautiful, it doesn't matter how good you are on the outside.

> Be mentally and spiritually sound. Because the moment you allow the way your body feels to influence how your mind and heart feel, you've lost.

## What's the point of living
You didn't go through all the ups and downs so that you can just keep it to yourself. You can't just sit on it and not share it with someone else. That's not the point of living anyways. Pay what you have got forward. That's what we are here to do.

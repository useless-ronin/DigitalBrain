# The Meaning of synthesizer has changed
You don't need to consume for the sake of consuming. you consume something that will help you solve a real world problem. Don't read something because someone said you should. Focus on the problems you are facing and change the problem.

Live. Solve problems. Fulfil desires. Save lessons from yourself and others and share it as you create it.

Our greatest prison is our own mind. Even if we are told the truth about our life, and the path to experience it, we wouldn't be able to grasp it not because of your ability or intelligence, rather simply due to the lack of exposure and having the opportunity to experience the experience.

Nothing is practical in this world until it is first non-negotiable. Nature gives nothing for free. If you want something, it should be non-negotiable.

To know something intellectually is to never have known it at all. If you want to learn the practicality of swimming, you have to dive into the pool. 

If you want freedom, you must know what you want freedom for and what you seek freedom for?

Be a man who is worthyof being vowed to. Be so through uncompromising sincerity. Be uncompromising. For it is the man who refuses to compromise holds the universe in his hands.

## The secret about success
Even the people who succeed don't understand about success. It's a self-created drams.
Hard work and practice are for those who try to become that which they secretly believe that is difficult for them to become. t

## [[004 ARCHIVE/How to live]] in ease
You may hear me, but in many ways the words will pass by. Anxiety and stress are a by-product and it can't be eliminated head-on. You must find the source from which it arises.

If you want to live a life of freedom and completely free of turmoil, you must have overwhelmingly genuine desire to live a lfie of Freedom. If your desire is genuine, learning will come. All things come by the way of sincerity.

## [[How to be a good parent]]
When you become a parent, you start playing a role of a father or mother. A parent never sees his child as another human being. He sees his child as another child. Thus, he is doomed from the beginning.

When you start playing a particular role, you only see from that perspective. But when you have no role, you begin to see a human being.

The child is independent of the parent and belongs to the nature. To be a good parent, you have to release yourself from the role of a parent.

Some people seek and some don't. We don't know why this happens.  Men who seek the truth are as rare as the rarest gem. A willingness to learn is rare among peple. 

## There is only one thing

## How to become the greatest
Processing something is one thing. Having access to it is another. To become the greatest, you have to win the fear. And the way to avoid fear is to take away the greed of winning.
You have to be freer. Only when you are free, your skill will be unleashed. Only when you learn the truth, it should set  you free.
If you want to be the greatest at something, you have to be a genuine student. You have to be willing to learn and listen to your master. You have to open your ears to let you access your powers. 



Ego locks away a man's skill because he thinks his life as a contest and thus he becomes limited. Don't be an egoistic man who competes over dime and dollar. Insist upon the glory of freedom.

You must understand what you wish to achieve and understand whuy is it that you fight. Your vision also should be greater than the greatest who have come before you. 

## How to stop caring?
Not caring is freedom. If you want to stop caring about other things, you have to let go of the very thing that is very dear to you, Happiness. You have to learn to be free of happiness. Because happiness is for fools.
People are emotionally attached because it comes out of the need of happiness.
Not caring for anything gives you freedom.

## How to find the truth?
We are told many things by many people. Even the mind tells us different things. If you want to know the truth, you have to understand that it can't be arrived at purely by the intellect. 
But when it strikes, something withing him reacts to it in a particular way. Truth is availabele to a few man but also to all man as a birthright. But only few men exercise their birthright.

 Nothing happens by accident and coincidence. Everything is by design. Nature has a way of giving man exactly what he desires. If the quest is genuine and intense, he cannot help but to have it. 

> why does one man devote his life to climbing Everest, while another doesn’t dare to leave his province? Why does one man seek to conquer the self, while another seeks to conquer the world? Why does one man seek to know Everything, while another is content with knowing what the world tells him?

There is no sincere answer to this. But you only have to know that it is so.

Truth is fundamentally different journey for every individual.


## What is mastery
Any man who does something better than others in knows something that the other don't

## What is [[The Secret to Confidence]]?
Confidence is not a product of comparison. It is a product of indifference. When you are indifferent to what others think and believe about you, confidence will always be with you.

If you learn that nothing really matters in this life, the indifference would be the natural byproduct. 

Don't try to convince someone for he will only understand from his perspective. If you tell the truth, only handful will agree and others will think that you are a madman. And a madman is never without confidence.

## What is intelligence?
Unlike we are taught our whole life, intelligence is not about knowing the facts and memorizing the information. If it was so, the encyclopedia and google would have been the most intelligent entity in existence.

Intelligence is not knowlege. It's not mere acculmulation of facts. It's not about passing an exam or having a degree certificate.

Intelligence is something that is attained by instinct rather than knowledge. Intelligence comes from a place way beyond the human mind.

When a man has a desire to know, the universe infuses it intor his bloodstream.
> To waste a minute is to waste a life.

## Are you happy?
Everyone in this world is chasing happiness.. But happiness is just a chase and nothing more. Chasing happiness means you forever hope for circumstances to go your way. But the circumstances are never in our control. We are bound to be unhappy and we remain in this chase for happiness.

> Abandon the idea of living for something. Rather seek to Experience.

Every creature in nature continually returs to the place they feel at home. Most people simply don't understand the subtle nature and workings of the human mind.

## What is life?
Life is pain. But almost all humans seek to improve. They try to be healthier, They try to be wise, They try to become happier. He lives in a perpetual state of not konwing. He lives in a perpetual state of Not understanding. And thus he suffers.

Have you ever seen a tree to trying to improve? or a flower or a bird? People act like a dog forever trying to catch its tail. He doesn't understand that the tail was not designed to be caught.

To know the truth and to experiecne is the necessity. It  sets you free. 

## Why should you help anyone?
Humans are fundamentally selfish by nature but not  necessarily unkind. The hard truth about life is no one carea about you or me. People only care about themselves. There are only rarest of rarest gems who are not selfish.

When you help someone, you are not being 'nice' by doing so. You are doing so because its nature. The reality is this: No one helps anyone. They do whatis in their nature to do.

## How to win?
Winning and losing doesn't matter. It's your duty to play the game. If you play with the goal of winning in mind, you will not be able to play. He who plays to win suffers. When you play to win, you lose your freedom.

But not playing to win doesn't mean you have to stop training or putting in the work. Its what the fools think and do. The wise man is who trains in order to perfect his skill, who refines himself towards the journey of perfecting himself. And when he fights, he fights without an ounce of fear. For he has nothing to lose.

## How to attain the Inner Quiet of the Mind
We seek to be quiet only when things are in chaos. But the mind is not designed in that particular way. You must take it all or leave it all.

## Do you believe in god?
> It seems to me that the only reason human beings wish to know about God is because they want something from him. If it was believed that God did not have the power to give, I do not believe any human being on earth would ever utter his name.

It doesn't matter weather god exists or not. You don't have to go looking after him. What will you do by finding him anyway?

Nobody knows if god exists or not. The only thing you have in this life is you. That's the only truth.

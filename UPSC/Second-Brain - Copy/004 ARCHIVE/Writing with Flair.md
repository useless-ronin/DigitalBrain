Don't think every tactic as a rule. Think of them as a tool. Most of the time these tools will serve you while sometimes they won't be.

Sometimes two principles may strike against one another. But then weight the different ones and use the one which sounds to be more important.

Simple, clear, elegant and evocativeness.

Simplicity= Make writing more punchy
Clarity= Make writing more comprehensive
Elegance= Makes writing flow more beautifully
Evocativeness= Makes writing stimulating

### Write with Integrity
As a good writer, it's never about showing off. Your sole aim is to communicate brilliantly. So cut out the needless words, the jargons as much as possible. Don't use words just to sound smart.

### Learn to connect with your readers
Write for your reader. An amaetur writer writes for himself whereas an elite writer writes for his audience

### Know your intention
Make your intention as clear as possible even before starting to write. There are 4 primary intents of a writer: **Inform, persuade, entertain and inspire**
Your intent makes a huge difference on how your writing looks in the end.

### Aspire for Beauty
An elite writer views himself as an artist. Your job is to add shape, rythm and structure to your writing to make it more aesthetic.

### Balance the Ingredients
You have to learn to balance simplicity, clarity, evocativeness, elegence. Sometimes you might have to remove clarity to make your writing more evocative, sometimes you might have to sacrifice simplicity to make your writing more elegant.
You have to view writing as an artist not technicians. 

### Don't be obsessed
Don't be obssessed about making your writing perfect. Allow the creative mind to gather ideas.

# Simplicity
Writing is easy to comprehend when there is less complexity. Anything that don't serve the purpose of your writing, eliminate it. It makes your writing more puncy.

## Don't use fancy and flowery language
When you come across something that is hard to comprehend and aren't plain, deconstruct the writing and try to simplify it in the plainest language possible.
You ask yourself after each sentence can I writ this more clearly? Can this be made more plain.

## Economical Writing
Your writing should be economical with excesss word. Cut out any fluff that don't serve your purpose.

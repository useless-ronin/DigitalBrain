-   If we see someone throwing money away, we call that person crazy. *Money has value. Wasting it seems nuts. And yet we see others—and ourselves—throw away something far more valuable every day: Time.*
    
    we often fail to think of the person who wastes time as crazy.
    
    It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested.
    
-   *he life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.*
    
-   “The part of life we really live is small.” 
    
-   When you think about the reason *most of us want to get wealthy, you will see it’s not for the money it’s for the time.* We want a clean schedule. *We want other people to do the things we don’t want to do. We want to spend money to buy time.*
    
-   *Wealth is best expressed by spending money to create time.*
    
> -   *“the rich invest in time; the poor invest in money.”*
    
> -   A man who dares to waste an hour of time has not discovered the value of his life.
    
-   How many times do you catch yourself ‘wasting time online,’ spending hours on Instagram not learning anything?
    
-   Four Ways We Misunderstand Time
    
-   1. Productivity: *We actually don’t want to be more productive. What we really want is more time.* And yet because we don’t properly value time, we never end up with more; even when we find ways to work more efficiently, we don’t actually use it wisely. We simply layer in more work.
    
-   2. Investing in Learning: The upfront costs are real and visible and, like any investment, the future payoff is uncertain. So *we tend to skim the surface, thinking this will “save us time” versus doing the real work.*
    
-   *surface learning is a true waste of time.*
    
-   3. Relationships:
    
-   *We’re often too “busy” to spend time with the ones we care about.*
    
-   4. Meetings:
    
-   *Lacking an agenda or decision, they become nothing more than half-a-meeting half-a-gossip session*. A giant waste of time.
    
-   *Time is invisible, so it’s easy to spend. It’s only near the end of our life that most of us will realize the value of time.*
    
-   Make sure you’re not [too busy to pay attention to life](https://fs.blog/2016/02/too-busy/).
    

-   Wealth is created not by spending your time making money but rather by saving your time to make money.

-   products that require 0 time and effort to sell after they have been built. They can replicate infinitely while being hosted online.
    
-   *You can start as a beginner and scale infinitely (with time, intelligence, and leverage).*
    
-   *I question everything, take the good advice, and discard what my gut tells me to.*
    
-   The Foundation: Experience
    
-   the world is going personal.
    
-   *The world craves authenticity and human connection.*
    
-   Big business does not do that.
    
-   More people are hiring independent contractors. Those that have some form of monetizable skillset will thrive.
    
-   The education industry is shifting before our eyes
    
-   The formal education system is broken and anyone can teach someone that is one step behind them.
    
-   look at YouTube, *there are people teaching marketing, Photoshop, productivity, and any other interest.*
    
-   They rake in cash when they create a beginner-level digital product & service stack â€” while fueling sales with their audience)
    
-   *Everyone needs to learn.*
    
-   If you are selling your time for money with your skills there is still the problem of time. We want autonomy.
    
-   *Doing unconventional thing*s (occasionally extreme), failing, and stacking lessons. *Iterating until you have the pieces to create an irresistible offer that nobody else can.*
    
-   NOBODY is going to go down the same exact path as you
    
-   *Experience IS your brand*. *Experience IS your message*. Experience is your USP, what *sets you apart from the competition.*
    
-   Experience is my notion of a "one-man business model."
    
-   Personal growth = business growth.
    
-   The Money: Unique Systems
    
-   you *make a lasting, valuable impact on humanity*. By changing an individual's human experience
    
-   *Transformations and systems that make it easy to acquire that SELL.*
    
-   One, because they are easily marketable to your past self. Two because they are not commoditized. Nobody else can sell it. Only you. Market research is already done.
    
-   This works incredibly well for digital products, consulting, and education offers
    
-   *Your content should revolve around 3 things:*
	- *Education*
	- *Entertainment*
	- *Inspiration*
    
-   The actionable advice you give from improving yourself and your skills. The authenticity you display by documenting your process and showing people your life. The growth you receive by dishing out your lessons in a way that the platform favors, allowing you to grow.
    
-   *People follow and buy from you because you are at a point in life that they want to be at.*
    
-   The Scaling Problem: Productization
    
-   There are people selling $20K+ per year memberships for a facebook group and weekly zoom calls.
    
-   ecause the person running it has immense and valuable experience. They have advice and systems that guarantee a higher result.
    
-   you don't have to even do consulting. There are social accounts pulling in $1M+ selling info products of their own unique systems.
    

-   *Given enough time, consistency, and experience - there is nothing preventing you from doing the same.*
    

-   you can slowly start to create the desired lifestyle you want. You can create your own schedule. You can stack experience in the places you want to.

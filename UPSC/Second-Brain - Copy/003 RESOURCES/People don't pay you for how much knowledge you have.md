-   The Surprisingly Effective Exercise That I Did For Six Consecutive Months
    
-   Grab a post-it note.
    

-   Write down *“What is value?”*
    

-   Post it on my computer.
    
-   At first, my answers were cliche. And I was getting frustrated.
    

-   But as time went by, I realized how profound the question was…
    

-   To create value, we must understand what value is.
    
-   And almost no one actually takes the time to understand value, especially when it comes to learning. Why?
    
-   *most of us store our knowledge in our minds.* This leads us to a fundamental truth...
    
-   *People don’t pay you for how much knowledge you hav*e. T*hey pay you for how well you package your knowledge.*
    
-   Imagine discovering an iron ore mine on an island. You know it has value. People use products made with iron every day.
    
-   But then you face a few problems.
    
-   You’re on an island. You don’t know what specific people would buy the ore, how much to charge for it, how to transport it across the world to buyers, or how to refine it. And once you figure these things out, it still takes a lot of work.
    
-   *We’re all sitting on millions of dollars worth of knowledge that we’ve spent decades learning*. But, it’s not enough to discover valuable knowledge….
    
-   *You have to package and refine it if you want others to experience its value.*
    
-   Here are some ways to package your knowledge, so that it’s worth a lot more:
    
-   *Coming up with compelling [Value Hooks](https://fo104.keap-link004.com/v2/click/a76c59355e99f5831ddfd0aff36473a5/eJyNkMFOwzAQRP_F5yxpm1CS3KqqqqKUHhCckbEXYtWxLXtNFar8Ow6gnkDiOjP7dmcvjNBwQ61kDXu1y0XJMuZRKKfQ0NYa4uLLvKvKolpkTCtz2nsbHWsuv81e_VldFkVVrjJGo8OUeXzYbLv2uH8-tMcuZR33acm_QNWquK3XV9LuftMe2DT9icZB0e490QNryEecS0mVitGT1ynfE7nQ5PmQ1DjcCDvkXAjU6DmhBGUItVZvaATm0Uj0gbiRQD0GhAoSkvoAs2SjB-H5xwhn67WEs9IaQpQSjR5h4CeEgCZNkYXRRqhfFusll_W6nlty59DInz93OH5fO30CQCWHwA==)*
    

-   Providing context on why you found something you curated valuable (see my Wednesday email: “How this learner got the attention of a famous venture capitalist…”)
    

-   *Showing how people can use your knowledge to get a result they want*
    
-   I love *learning for the sake of fulfilling my own curiosity.* That alone is valuable enough for me.
    
-   When I mastered how to package my knowledge, I had people hire me for six-figure consulting contracts. I began charging 250 dollars, then 500 per hour as a coach and consultant.
    
-   *I didn't have to pitch myself. People came to me eager to pay for my expertise..*.
    
-   I also helped others achieve the same transformation. Here’s what Wilson said:
    
-   ... I applied [one of your concepts] to a client proposal, and secured a 1.6M contract as a result. I now know how to break things down in a way that others understand, value and share — which helps with my thought leadership as well as businesses.”

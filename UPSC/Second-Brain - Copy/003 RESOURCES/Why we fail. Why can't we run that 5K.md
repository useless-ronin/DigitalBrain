   In Behavioural Economics, “discounting” is the idea that when we make plans for the future, *we minimise how bad (or good) the future is going to be*
    
-   For me, it was always *underestimating the magnetic lure of a warm comfy bed against the cold harsh whipping morning air.* It was not taking into account how tired I actually am at 5 a.m. It was not realising that my fiery motivation to get running was simply a daytime thing, and not an early morning thing.
    
-   Behavioural science calls this *“time inconsistent preferences.”* This manifests when *we don’t view our future self as “I,” but rather reduce “future me” to some other person*. It’s that person who has to deal with feeling tired, with running late, with a lack of motivation. Not me!
    
-   Time inconsistent preferences and discounting can *lead us to overestimate our future commitment or willingness to expend energy* (i.e. running).
    
-   If I didn’t wake up at 5 a.m., then I was never going to go for a run that day, even if I had the entire day free. I was throwing the baby out with bath water.
    
-   To start running, I had to adjust my calculations.
    
-   I started the night before. Before going to sleep, I took a moment to be considerate to future me. I dragged my running shoes from the depths of the closet, and left them at the foot of my bed. I tracked down my running jacket and laid it beside the shoes
    
-   A peace deal was reached with my alarm. Instead of the ritualistic snooze battle from 6 a.m. onwards, I set the alarm to a more agreeable time — 7:30 am.
    
-   The next day, for the first time in weeks, I woke up fully awake. I looked down at my running shoes, and thought of the dark, cold morning waiting for me outside.
    
-   I cut myself a deal. Instead of the 5k run, I’d give myself the slack to just go for a lap of my neighbourhood instead. Something was better than nothing, right? I opened the front door. The fresh air filled my lungs and outside had that early morning calm about it. That sealed the deal and outside I went. I completed a walk around my quiet, cool neighbourhood and headed home, refreshed and satisfied that I’d made some progress.
    
-   What did I actually change about the process leading up to my morning that allowed me to get out of bed and onto the sidewalk? Let me introduce behavioural principle #1 that I used in my running journey:
    
-   1.  #1 *Environment determines your behaviour, not the other way around.*
        
    2.  Suddenly, running tomorrow isn’t a hardship some other me has to deal with, it’s something I can plan for and set my future self up for success. Future me didn’t have to deal with tiredly trying to find shoes and a jacket in a messy closet. *By doing these small actions the night before, I removed enough hurdles to get out the door.*
        
    3.  n laying the right foundation to support myself getting started, I had also unwittingly taken the first step in *chunking my goal — breaking it up into smaller, more manageable pieces*. This leads to the second behavioural principle, and the second half of this running saga:
        
    4.  2. Chunking, or incremental behavioural change, is the scientifically proven way to achieve your goals.
        
    5.  Breaking down your goals, or chunking, them into smaller pieces is an effective way at breaking down lofty goals into smaller bite-sized pieces. This allows you to keep moving forward, building on your consistency and levelling up when you’re ready for it.
        
    6.  The next steps were to increase my pace, and move from walking every morning to running every morning.
        
    7.  Each day of walking was easier than the last. After a few weeks of walking, somehow, a 5 minute jog didn’t seem like the worst idea in the world. Soon, I was able to get out most (but definitely not all) mornings and go for a quick jog.
        
    8.  I didn’t feel ready for that big of a run, but I started to wonder if I could go just a bit longer than 5 minutes. What about 10 minutes, or even 20?
        
    9.  I decided to give it a go. I set myself up for the perfect morning. Woke up refreshed, shoes, jacket and headphones waiting for me. I breezed through my morning routine and was out the door. I started my normal jogging route. I was absolutely flying! Had I ever felt so good running before? Surely I could hit 20 minutes easy. I looked down at my watch, expecting 15 minutes to have gone by. A lone 6 stared back at me.
        
    10.  My legs were pleading with my brain to stop.
        
    11.  Somehow, I managed to run the entire 20 minutes without stopping, even when my motivation abandoned me. Even though my legs were begging for a break, my lungs emphatically agreeing, somehow, I was able to persevere.
        
    12.  *Chunking, like it sounds, isn’t glamorous. It’s not going to change your behaviour over night.* Yet, it’s one of the most powerful ways to change your behaviour. Slow and steady wins the race.
        
    13.  Like a one-two punch, chunking combined with fostering a healthy environment, allowed me to take those first critical steps and knock my goals out of the park. Knowing what behavioural barriers are plotting your demise allows you to navigate around them. *Facing the barriers head on and tackling them one at a time is a sure-fire way to succeed.*

-   Humans are lazy they tend to phase out what they don't like doing right
    
-   people that make the most money or see the most success in the world are creative people
    
-   not the people that are working um manual low-skill labor drops
    
-   over time things have been getting phased out
    
-   As a bad thing but the people that either believe in themselves or know that they have a higher potential and know that they have the possibility of learning new skills and increasing their skill set improving their skill set through self-education and the endless ocean of resources online and just taking a few hours a day to actually do that those people
    
-   Creative solutions you build open up more opportunity and creativity for others
    
-   they understand human nature and they understand that all you have to do is understand how other people perceive value
    
-   you create a solution that someone else wants and then they buy it from you and that's how you make a creative income
    
-   sixty percent of the new jobs or sixty percent yeah of new jobs haven't been created
    
-   you have people you Have value you bridge the gap
    
-   if the work doesn't require creativity delegate it automate it or leave it
    
-   you need to take personal responsibility For your future and increase your own skill set so you don't get phased out
    
-   the ability to create Certainty from uncertainty or create signal from noise or meaning from struggle
    
-   nature is creative you are creative god is creative the universe is creative whatever form or interpretation of the higher intelligence that exists Out there is creative
    
-   what people think is creativity and what creativity actually
    
-   what people think creativity is is usually dependent on a skill like design or art or something that implies more creativity than a technical skill
    
-   true form of creativity is best explained with this graphic that i have created and am throwing up right now
    
-   creativity equals create plus clarity
    
-   creative solutions to modern problems are how you make the big bucks
    
-   it's our job to take that make that creation with our mind and put it out into the world so other people can benefit from it
    
-   Connecting those dots is how you make a creative solution to a modern problem
    
-   there is no saturation or competition in creative markets or free markets
    
-   your job on this earth is to help people advance in stages of development by Giving them a creative solution to do so and helping them navigate the rocks and the the roadblocks that you encountered on the way up to the top of the mountain
    
-   you're figuring it out and you're continuing moving towards your vision for the future or whatever it may be your goals
    
-   creative abilities are harnessed by so few
    
-   i sound like i'm attacking the school system when it's it's a blessing and a curse where there are fundamental aspects of reality to get everyone on the same page so we can actually operate as a society that we need to be informed or made aware of through the school system and through assigned work
    
-   It's it's almost impossible it is impossible to avoid external conditioning or just being made aware of things from other people as you are growing up that's how you like learn to survive and operate in the world
    
-   it is very easy especially in this modern world to just go about life unconsciously
    
-   you need to cultivate that value of personal responsibility in your life create your own vision for your future create your own set of values create your own routines to operate by create a code for your life that helps that is conducive to optimal outcomes in your Life
    
-   in short it's about not accepting handouts or putting your fate or your future in another person's hands
    
-   taking responsibility for your future and being able to use the vast amount of information that is being put online anything
    
-   reators are creating their own jobs i don't even know what i do for work what would i label myself maybe
    
-   i understand what is perceived as valuable i have developed myself to a point where i can help people reach the levels that i have and i attract an audience of people that want to do similar things as
    
-   your design skill isn't inherently valuable if you can apply that skill to help people improve and develop themselves to a new stage in order to reach some desired outcome in their life then that's perfectly fine
    
-   in order to reach these new stages and make more money you can't expect people to just give it to you you have to dive into the unknown you have to figure it Out for yourself and you have to be able to create clarity for those under you
    
-   it's all people helping those that are under them in terms of the developmental stages
    
-   what you see as extremely valuable in your life based on what you've been made conscious of throughout your entire life and what you have been conditioned to believe is going to be completely different from the next person
    
-   the way you kind of harness this is by studying human nature human understanding you know studying the people that are going to give you their money
    
-   people want people may or may not some may or may not pay to make their experience on this earth Worse that's not what people want people want to make their experience better they want to feel better they want to experience a better life they want to have novel experiences
    
-   human understanding is an iceberg that everyone should master
    
-   if you have no idea what to learn i would recommend diving into marketing persuasion and sales
    
-   you don't need the perfect Top rated recommended by everyone book you need to expose yourself to the information see what you are curious about as you are reading through that and then continue diving down the rabbit hole and either buying books or researching online or buying courses or investing in yourself as a whole
    
-   stop relying on me to externally condition you
    
-   marketing sales persuasion branding

-   don't follow those people that are flexing the false lifestyles
    
-   follow the people that are truly putting out good informatio
    
-   you buy a book you follow people on social media uh you read articles on blogs you listen to podcasts
    
-   immerse yourself and gain a deep understanding of marketing sales persuasion branding and just human Understanding in general
    
-   eventually things won't make sense at first you're like what what is this guy talking about with this whole marketing strategy stuff
    
-   things start to come together you start to connect the dots and eventually you have a path to the solution and now you can test that system or that process or that path and once it works and gets results for you and you've experienced it then you can take that and give it to other people
    
-   aining specific knowledge by pursuing your genuine curiosity with this stuff
    
-   i don't want to hear that you don't want to start a business or become an entrepreneur because it's in your nature
    
-   your job is to start a personal brand right so a youtube channel or a twitter account
    
-   you're creating something that you can tie your learnings to so you can apply them right because if you're just learning and not doing anything with it you're not learning you really aren't you're not gaining practical experience that can help other
    
-   Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for if society can train you it can train someone else and replace you specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now

-   you need is a newsletter
    
-   you need a twitter account
    
-   and a creative solution or potential solution to iterate on
    
-   t i enjoy creating these videos because it forces me to take what i'm learning and package it up in a way that hopefully makes sense to you
    
-   the first thing you do when you start learning is one you create a project you don't just start learning you create a project so you can apply the information to it so you start a twitter account and you start educating yourself
    
-   you pursue your genuine curiosity is by learning the principles and fundamentals and trying a bunch of different things and seeing what you want to dive deeper into and not Suppressing that curiosity
    
-   you can help other people learn those that are one to two steps behind you and want to reach that next stage of development
    
-   you can help people with you can either start with a minimum viable offer of something
    
-   from helping other people you are learning more you are expanding your awareness more to know what gets results and then you'll be able to craft this process that you can replicate over time and eventually package up and sell to Other people as a more expensive consulting or freelance offer or into let's say a digital product or even if the way of achieving a desired outcome comes
    
-   Way you do this is by working your way up the ladder
    
-   you start posting online you start hitting roadblock
    
-   you solve your own problems or someone else's problems if you already have expertise in a specific area you talk about that in an engaging way and then you eventually package up a system and sell it to them
    
-   you start with free work first right whether that be just posting content online or just getting
    
-   you eventually get better you eventually create a better solution you eventually charge more and then you can go and productize that creative system

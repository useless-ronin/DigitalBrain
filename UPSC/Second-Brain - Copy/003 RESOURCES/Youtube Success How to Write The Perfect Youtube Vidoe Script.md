- Filming time, quality of video and making time gets reduced if you do video scripting

## The Youtubers Notebook
- Video Ideas should be captured when they strike.
- Capture Ideas, take notes

## Noting Great Video Ideas Down
- Intro
- Middle
- Outro
- What are you going to say in those individual videos
- Have clear idea of how you want your video to go
## INTRO
- Show your problem and how you solved it. Add a little bit of drama
- Show them your transformation and how they can achieve that transformation too
- Add a promise at the beginning of your video(They will learn something new or the information will help them solve their problem)
- The video can flow afterwards but a scripted INTRO is very important to hook your viewers
## The Main Video Content
- Intro makes your video free flow easily
- Don't write word for word of your mid part
- Write key points you want to mention and examples you want to mention
- Becomes more natural
## The OUTRO
- Say Thank You.
- Be flexible. Freestyle. 
- You don't need to script unless you want to
## Reading Your Script
- Have something smart to look at infront of you below your camera
## Delivering The Scripted Video
- If you can't deliver naturally, everything goes in vain. 
- Pauses and Mistakes can be edited out in the video
- Take your time, do it again, Edit the mistakes, Have breaks, 
- Use hand gestures
	- Makes you feel more natural and freestyle
- **Speak, look at the sciprt, speak. Speak, look at the script and speak**

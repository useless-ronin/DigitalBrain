-   forex is all about risk management. **You can spend 10 hours everyday on the market and still perform worse than a dude that spends 30min a da**y but has a better risk management/ strategy.
    
-   Here's the secret - **until you know exactly what you're looking for, staring at the market is a complete waste of time**.
    
-   Once you know exactly what you're looking for, market analysis takes barely a glance at the charts.
    
-   I trade Daily and 4H almost exclusively.
    
-   Most of my work is done on Sundays. It's just easier to plan trades when the market is closed. I plot the pairs that seem interesting and tradable, write down my watchlist, usually takes around 2-4 hours max.
    
-   I only **trade on candle close**, so when the market is moving I only look at the charts again every 4 hours. I am a full time equity fund manager so most of the day I am instead watching equities.
    
-   **Trading: one or two.**
    
-   **Studying: all of them.**
    
-   Im not profitable(yet), but remember this is a career were if you stop learning youll lose your edged.
    
-   I **probably trade for 1 hr and spend the next 4hrs studying charts and backtesting**. i woke up 4:00 am to look at some charts during the London-New york overlap, an I didnt take any trades, and now Im backtesting. and ill probably be on the computer till the wife gets home (3pm). I want this more than anything so Im giving it my all, but I also know that just because I wanted dosent mean Im gonna get it.
    
-   **if there is no set up you don't trade... keep it simple.** its hard because you want to trade, but if you dont see anything, don't bother
    
-   I spend usually an hour a day. My profitability ranges from 6-35% on my best months. Been trading fx 7 years now. Mind you I swing trade and use a rsi scanner that scans 28 pairs. I get an alert on my phone for overbought or oversold for the 1h, 4h, 1 day. 1h is good to use for buying retracement following the daily trend. 4h and 1 day is where the weekly swings happen. If any pair is overbought oversold at a weekly fib pivot level I take the trade. Stops are 1.5 daily ATR. Usually r61/s61 r100/s100 is good for weekly reversals. Weekly pivot and r38/s38 is good to buy retracement.
    
-   Like few minutes per session, involves scrolling through my watchlist for potential setups, each pair takes 2-3 seconds to analyze depending on whether a setup is forming or not. I do this a few times a day. I trade the H1.
    
-   Trading, as any other profession, requires a lot of time - of course if it is your profession, not a hobby. Your counterpart in trading - best traders in the world, equiped by newest computers and advanced newsfeeds, with high quality education and many years of experience
    
-   That is why it is very unusaul to see newbie traders beliveing it is possible to be successful trader paying minimum efforts.
    
-   The main idea is that trader should evaluate how he spends his time to avoid wasting time on different unimportant things.
    
-   he idea is to save your time reducing the time spending on routine tasks. It will be better to use that free time for self-education.
    
-   To become a real successful daytrader one should trade full time. At the same time, it is possible to be a successful swing trader spending 4-5 hours per day, but you should know how you spend every minute.

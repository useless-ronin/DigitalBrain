We all are salesman in this world. And everything we do throughout our lives is some sort of sale. Nothing moves in this world without sales. And no other profession has more opportunity has opportunity to rise from poverty to great wealth that that of salesman.

Make wealth. Keep what's necessary and donate to people in need. Wealth should never be the goal of your life. Strive for happiness, to be loved and to love, most of all to acquire a peace of mind and serenity. Without money, you can't achieve any of these things unless you decide to go to the mountains and meditate.

Without obstacles, the rewards are not good. Victory only comes after you win over the obstacles. Don't fear trying and failing. Fear not trying. Fear leaving the world without even making a move. 

> “Failure will never overtake you if your determination to succeed is strong enough.”

Whenever you are in doubt, fear or any emotional discomfort, go back to your why. Listen to it and meditate on it.

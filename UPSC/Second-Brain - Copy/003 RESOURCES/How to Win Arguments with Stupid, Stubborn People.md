How to Win Arguments with Stupid, Stubborn People | by Sean Kernan | Mind Cafe | Feb, 2022 | Medium

-   Churchill was a difficult man, with a strong personality and a willingness to stand behind his point.
    
-   The two went back and forth until she finally said, “If I were your wife, I’d poison your coffee.”
    
-   Churchill retorted, “If I were your husband, I’d drink it.”
    
-   The truth is — *I hate arguing. I don’t like conflict*. But I’ve studied the hell out of argumentation because it’s so important.
    
-   *Making a good, strong argument is necessary* for securing a raise, deescalating a conflict, suffering fools, protecting friendships, and much more.
    
-   Snipe an argument like a champ
    
-   Rule 1: *Don’t come in too hot — and that doesn’t just refer to emotions.*
    
-   in courtrooms, [it’s proven](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19297636/#:~:text=Expert%20witness%20confidence%20had%20a,perceptions%20of%20expert%20witness%20credibility) that witnesses are more credible to juries when they express moderate, rather than low or high confidence. It has a direct impact on verdict outcomes and sentencing.
    
-   When you have low confidence, you seem unsure of yourself and what you're saying.
    
-   Paul Graham, [created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Graham%27s_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.svg) a hierarchy of disagreement, ranking the best and worst strategies for debate. *The lowest are personal attacks and name-calling.*
    
-   The #1 way to argue is to *stick with a strong central point*. *Don’t repeat it over and over. Just build everything around it.*
    
> -   “Always stick to the thing you’re arguing about.”
    
-   They turn a simple disagreement into a nuclear holocaust.
    
-   By the end of the argument, your head is spinning and on fire. You can’t even remember what the original argument was about.
    
-   Arguing when you are certain you are correct
    
-   *There’s nothing better than knowing you can dunk on someone.*
    
-   *You know you have the science. You have the logic. You have the standards for human decency.*
    
-   *When you come in guns blazing with all of your clear evidence, the other person will lock up. They’ll feel bullied and incapable of hearing you out.*
    
-   The best arguers are proven to *use a small number of key points*. They don’t rapid-fire or clap in the person's face while they talk.
    
-   They *ask questions*. They know *changing someone’s mind is damn-near impossible*. By asking questions, that person will change their own mind.
    
-   In all of that name-calling and horrible language and aggression, *I’ve never seen a single person stop and say, “You know what, you are right. I’m wrong. We’ve all learned a lot today.”*
    
-   It’s as HG Wells wrote, *“The first man to raise a fist is the man who’s run out of ideas.”*
    
-   Dealing with real-life yelling and toxicity
    
-   When someone is upset suddenly, express calm curiosity at their emotions and why they are upset.
    
-   *Staying calm conveys your own strength while also validating that you care about their emotions.*
    
-   *The worst possible thing you can do is shout back.*

- Why We Procrastinate?
	- Physical, mental and emotional effort
	- Deadlines
	- If you don't have deadlines, you migh as well end up procrastinating infinitely
	- Fear of failure
- Temporal motivation theory
	- Desirable reward
	- Expectation to win
	- Reward more than present status
	- Immediate result
- Action will make you regret in the short term but inaction will make you regret in the long term.

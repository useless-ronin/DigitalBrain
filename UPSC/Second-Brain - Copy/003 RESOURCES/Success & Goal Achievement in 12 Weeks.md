## Introduction
### Four things you need for succeeding
- A clear vision
- 12 weeks year
- Execution
- Weekly planner review
No magic tricks. Complicated systems don't work.

### Change is a slow process, 99% of the time
You need to do something in practice. Knowing is not enough. You have to do. You can't change without acting. Do little things consistently. Evolution is a slow process.

- There is no plan. Focus on now skills and relationships you can build
- Work on strengths, not weaknesses: 
- Persistence wins over talent.

### Success for real
Success is about being happy. It is personal too. We all have different matrics. You need to be clear about what success is to you. Write it down. Don't live in dream. Live in the real. Act today.

### The Success formula
- Trying vs doing with feedback
- Talent is something you can have. Wit effort you can have any talent. Talent is the greatest factor in the success equation.
- Have hierchical goals. Have one goal with multiple lower level goals. Lower level goals can be replaced.
- *Trying to do 20 pushups* vs *doing 10 pushups*
- With effort, you can master any skill and reach your goal.

## Goal Achievement
### Not SMART Goals
- Specific: 5W
	- What I want to accomplish?
	- Why is this goal important?
	- Who is involved?
	- Where is it located?
	- Which resources or limits are affected?
- Measurable
	- Gives you concrete evidence of your achievenment
- Realistic
	- Be honest
- Achievable
	- Is it the right moment for you?
- Rekevant
	- Does this goal matter to you?
- Time-based
	- Have a deadline put on a 
You need a plan or a system. You don't need a complicated systems. It should be plain simple.

**Biggest mistake:** People are not clear about goal achievement and what they want to achieve in their life.

Goal and habits

### How to find a purpose or a goal to achieve
There is no growth without goals. Think about who you are and what you are before thinking about your future. What situation are you in? Different areas of your life? Your failures? Finances? Relationships?

#### Creative writing to clarify aspsects of your life
- What you want?
- How you feel about your past of your future?
- What would you do to improve your life?
- What are you planning to lean in the next 12 months
- Think about your life values instead of purposes.

### The one thing and the domino effect
If you spend your time and energy on things that are not really important, you will have no time to work on the important things.
Priortization is important. You have to work on important things.

Domino effect activates a chain reaction. Creating a big change in life is about creating a domino effect. Extraordinary success is sequential not instantaneous. 

Trying to do too many things at once is ill suited strategy. Too many good intentions. The best thing you can do is work on just one thing. Your choice must be your priority.

Work your priority.

Change your life without changing.

## 12 Week Year
Instead of purusing a big goal in a year, you do it in 12 weeks. Divide your goal in 2 or more parts if necesssary. 
- Week 0: Preparation week
4 components:
- Macro planner
- Action list
- Progress measurement
- WPR: weekly planner & review
Define milestones for every week. Be realistic. Take care of your calendar and your future agendas

### Actions, progress and scorekeeper
In 12 weeks, you should work not plan.
- **The actions we need to do**
	- Sharpen the saw
	- If you know what to do and when to do, your chances of failure decreases dramatically
	- Unexpected events
		- Plan what to do incase of unexpected events
- **How to measure your progress**
	- Use a scorekeeper

### Weekly planner review
Every sunday take 5-10 minutes for review your week and your goals. What did you do? What didn't you do? What you can do now?

### Create a blog to sell an info product

## Tips to achieve goals
### Decision Fatigue
The more decisions you make, the more your ability to decide decreases. Decision fatigue makes us not able to take the right decisions despite our good intentions and willpower. Tips to prevent decision fatigue:
- Reduce the number of decision during the day
- Schedule your day
- Make important decision in the morning
- Simplify your life with routines
- Plan beforehand
When we can't decide and struggle for making a choice, our brain uses a lot of energy towards it.

### The obstacle is the way
Facing our problems is a great way to be better. Be disciplined and persistant.

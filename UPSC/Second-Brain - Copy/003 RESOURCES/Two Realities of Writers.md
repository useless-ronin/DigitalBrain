Fake gurus will never do what Stephen King, Yuval Harari, Malcolm Gladwell did to become successful writers - prakashjoshipax@gmail.com - Gmail

-   When it comes to standing out online, there are two realities.
    

-   Which reality you’re in will determine your destiny…
    

-   Are you ready for this? :)
    
-   *Fake vs. Real Expertise:* Two Different Realities
    
-   Sharing first-take opinions — whatever that comes to mind. Learn and share the same ideas as everyone else. Publish lots and lots of content.
    
-   This is the quick path to becoming an expert.
    
-   *You will get some results.* For example, you will be able to add a few top publications to your name and build a decent following.
    
-   *But it’s also a path to fake expertise.* Now, this sounds harsh, so let me explain.
    
-   (You might be surprised to see Mr. Beast mentioned here — more about him in my next week’s email…)
    
-   It’s a completely different reality. A reality that will scare most people but excite the truly committed.
    
-   *You focus on finding the best of knowledge that humanity has already figured out — the most valuable knowledge that most people haven’t learned or realized.*
    
-   It’s a slow path. For some time, *you won’t get as many followers as those who follow the quick path*.
    
-   But *it’s the path to finding and creating ideas that will leave behind a legacy*.
    
-   Your legacy.
    
-   Jim Collins is known for ideas like Big Hairy Audacious Goal and Flywheel (the latter has been faithfully adopted by Jeff Bezos).
    
-   Malcolm Gladwell is known for the 10,000-Hour Rule concept, which changed how we see expertise.
    
-   And if you’re into marketing, you will have heard about Permission-Based Marketing or Purple Cow from Seth Godin.
    
-   My story of failing on the fast path
    
-   When I was in college, I was on the fast path. I wrote 500 blog posts and hundreds of Facebook posts. I bought tons of bestselling books and courses. My efforts flopped miserably — a few handful of views on my blog and that was it.
    
-   My failure scared me for many years — it was only in 2013 that I got back into writing.
    
-   I was desperate to do something different, and I made the commitment to switch to the slow path...
    
-   For any topic, I’d plow through classic books and research studies for weeks if not months. I wanted to be a world-class expert in what I was learning , so that I could create my own unique path forward (vs. just copying others or publishing more content).
    
-   The hard work paid off beyond my wildest imagination.
    

-   My ideas attracted tens of millions of views, and they have been published in Forbes, Inc. Magazine, Fortune, HBR, and other top publications.

The warning against being a generalist has persisted for [hundreds of years in dozens of languages](http://snip.ly/rrLW). “*Equipped with knives all over, yet none is sharp*,” warn people in China. In Estonia, it goes, “Nine trades, the tenth one — hunger.”
    
-   many of the most impactful individuals, both contemporary and historical, have been generalists: Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Richard Feynman, Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Marie Curie to name just a few.
    
-   The Era of the Modern Polymath
    
> -   “The future belongs to the integrators.” — Educator Ernest Boyer
    
-   I define a modern *polymath as someone who becomes competent in at least three diverse domains and integrates them into a top 1-percent skill set*.
    
-   many now believe that to become world-class in a skill, they must complete 10,000 hours of deliberate practice in order to beat the competition, going as deep as possible into one field.
    
-   Modern polymaths go against the grain of this popular advice, *building atypical combinations of skills and knowledge across fields and then integrating them to create breakthrough ideas and even brand new fields and industries where there is little competition.*
    
-   In order to become an effective online writer, I’ve deliberately combined academic research, digital journalism, and growth hacking into one skillset.
    
-   didn’t go to college for any of these skills, but practiced them over time and received coaching on them.
    
-   *Why Being A Modern Polymath Is The New Normal*
    
> -   “Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses — especially learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.”
    
-   — Leonardo Da Vinci
    
-   In today’s world, diverse interests are not a curse, they’re a blessing. Being a polymath instead of a specialist is an advantage, not a weakness.
    
-   People who love learning across fields can use that tendency to be more financially successful and impactful in their career.
    
-   Polymath Advantage 1: *Creating an atypical combination of two or more skills that you’re merely competent can lead to a world-class skill set.*
    
    -   If you want something extraordinary [in life], you have two paths:
        
    -   1. *Become the best at one specific thing*. 2. *Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.*
        
    -   . It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.
        
-   Polymath Advantage 2: *Most creative breakthroughs come via making atypical combinations of skills.*
    
-   The top performing studies cited atypical combinations of other studies (90 percent conventional citations from their own field and 10 percent from other fields).
    
-   Polymath Advantage 3: *It’s easier and faster than ever to become competent in a new skill.*
    
    -   The quality of knowledge in every domain is improving.
        
    -   The technology field is smarter than it was 20 years ago, for example. So are the fields of physics and biology.
        
    -   Second, there is an abundance of free or affordable content from the world’s top experts in every medium you can think of.
        
    -   This is the golden era for people who value learning, are willing to invest in themselves, and who are disciplined enough to take action on their own.
        
    -   As Isaac Newton famously proclaimed, *“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”* In today’s era, we have more shoulders to stand on than ever.
        
-   Polymath Advantage 4: *It’s easier than ever to pioneer a new field, industry, or skill set.*
    
    -   While the explosion of knowledge is making it impossible or at least more difficult for anyone to know everything, it has also made it easier to find one big, atypical combination of fields or skills. It’s easier than ever to be a polymath.
        
    -   And finally, as the number of new skills increases, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially
        
    -   Every new chunk of knowledge can theoretically be combined with every other knowledge chunk. Every new breakthrough creates the potential for exponentially more breakthroughs.
        
    -   I remember [reading](http://amzn.to/2FOp4Uq) how a young *Leonardo Da Vinci was frustrated that he was born in a period where everything worth being discovered had already been discovered.*
        
    -   It’s helpful for us to remember Da Vinci’s quote, because it’s just as true today. *Almost ALL of the potential discovery that humanity will do is in the future*.
        
-   Polymath Advantage 5: *It future-proofs Your career.*
    
> -   “It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.” -Charles Darwin
    
-   What do the following six professions have in common?
    
-   1.  App developer
        
    1.  Social media manager
        
    2.  Driverless car engineer
        
    3.  Cloud computing specialist
        
    4.  Big data scientist
        
    5.  YouTube content creator
        
-   Answer: None of them existed 15 years ago. Imagine the power you’d have *if you could go back in time, master these skills, and then be one of the best in the world at them when they hit big*? We actually don’t have to guess. You’d stand a good chance of being a millionaire. The headline below shows just how valuable a driverless car engineer is.
    
-   *So what skills are going to be valuable in 20 years? Do you know?*
    
-   No? Neither do I. Neither does anybody.
    
-   So the question arises, *how do we make investments in knowledge now that will pay off far into the future?*
    
-   I’d make the case that a polymath is much better positioned than a specialist. A *polymath can take the skills that she or he has learned and combine them in new ways quickly to master new fields*. On the other hand, a specialist whose fields becomes obsolete would likely take much more time to adapt to the change and have to start back at the beginning.
    
-   In an environment of accelerating change, *we’re going to have to become polymaths to survive*. We’re going to have a dozen careers. Each one is going to require new skills.
    
-   Polymath Advantage 6: *It sets you up to solve more complex problems.*
    
-   Many of the largest problems that face society and individuals benefit from solutions that integrate multiple disciplines.
    
-   Polymath Advantage 7: *It helps you stand out and compete in the global economy.*
    
-   One of the most fundamental mental models from economics is supply and demand ([see more valuable mental models](https://www.mentalmodelclub.com/mental-model-club-v2.html?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=16&utm_content=CTA1)). It’s relevant to the job market, to goods and services, to the world of ideas, and to many other places.
    
-   *You can have the most valuable skill set in the world, but if everyone also has that skill set, then you’re a commodity*. By becoming a polymath and developing a unique skill set that few others have, then you’ll be able to differentiate yourself and charge more.
    
-   *“What’s the one thing you believe is true that no one else agrees with you on?”* This simple question very quickly tells you whether or not you have rare and valuable ideas. If you can’t come up with anything, it tells you that you might not be as an original thinker as thought you were.

-   “In order to get into the top of the performance distribution, you have to escape from the crowd.” — Howard Marks, founder of Oaktree Capital ($2+ billion net worth)
    
>    *“You can’t make money agreeing with the consensus view.”* — Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates (largest hedge fund in the world)
    
>   “The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.” — Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and billionaire investor ($3.3 billion net worth)
    
>   “You have to be odd to be number 1.” -Dr. Seuss
    
-   The weakness of an art is its dogma. And when I’m competing against an individual from a different discipline, I try to find the dogma of that discipline. When I’m competing with someone within a discipline, I try to find their personal dogma. — Josh Waitzkin, Chess Grandmaster & World Tai Chi Champion
    
-   Bottom Line: *Make Yourself Anti-Fragile*
    
-   Being a polymath will be the new normal, and polymaths who synthesize diverse skills to create breakthrough innovations and solve complex problems will have a huge impact.
    
-   specialists risk getting trapped by their success.
    
-   Changes to the environment make them stronger. As new paradigms of business emerge or their passions grow, they can quickly combine their existing skill sets in a myriad of ways.
    
-   **How To Become a Modern Polymath**
    
    -   “The greatest scientists are artists as well.” — Einstein
        
    -   The idea of becoming a modern polymath can be overwhelming. Where do you start? What field do you learn first? How do you find the time? How do you translate what you learn into real world value?”
        
    -   During the hundreds of hours I’ve spent researching how to be a polymath and interviewing polymaths, one key that I’ve discovered is mental models.
        
    -   First, **mental models transcend disciplines**. They are the invisible links that connect disciplines together:
        
    -   *mental models help you learn multiple skills much more quickly, because they gave your a stable base of useful and universal knowledge that you can use for the rest of your life*
        
    -   *In short, [mental models are key to becoming a better polymath](https://medium.com/the-mission/this-is-exactly-how-you-should-train-yourself-to-be-smarter-infographic-86d0d42ad41c).*

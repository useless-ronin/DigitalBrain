-   Many authors write what they know. I don’t. *I write about what I want to know.*
    
-   When I’m struggling with one thing or another, my first step is to think through the problem myself.
    
-   I’ll [make time](https://www.nirandfar.com/timeboxing/) for [introspection](https://www.nirandfar.com/introspection/). About 80 percent of the time, if I [schedule](https://www.nirandfar.com/schedule-maker/) time to really think about a problem, without [distraction](https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/), I’ll find some answers to get me going on the right path.
    
-   The next step is to *hit the books and see what’s been written about the topic.*
    
-   if after thinking through the question, talking it out with Julie, and then reading everything I can about the problem, *I’m still not satisfied, that’s when I know I need to write a book on the subject.*
    
-   Writing 30,000 words of something I’m proud to share with the world takes years of consistent effort.
    
-   My mantra while writing has always been, *“follow your curiosity.”*
    
-   *As long as I want to know the answer to a question, I have the fuel I need to keep going.*
    
-   Rather, *I blog my way through the book*. I’ll take interesting parts of the problem and break it down into posts I publish here on [Medium](https://nireyal.medium.com/) and on my blog, [NirAndFar.com](http://nirandfar.com).
    
-   By consistently publishing an article weekly, I chew on the topic enough to offer readers something interesting but more importantly, I answer tidbits of the bigger questions in what will eventually become the book.
    
-   *I write way more articles than ever make it into the book*. But along the way, I hit on themes that I explore further in fleshed-out chapters in the final edition of the book.

## Set the table
Define your purpose. Define your goals. Clear written goals can have an enormous impact on your life. The more clear you are about your future, the greater impact it will have on your present actions. Clarity will help you delay instant gratification in the short-term for a greater rewards in the long term. 

They motivate you to take actions. Goals are the fuel which drive you. Goals will make you excited about living a life. 

## Plan your day in advance
> Planning is bringing your future to present so that you can do something about it. - Alan Lakein

Always work from a list. Have different list for different purpose. Plan your year, month, weeks and days. Make sure you live your day in your mind before you live in the reality. Priortize your goals on paper. You will find it much easier to execute.

## Apply the 80/20 Rule
Use the pareto's principle. Always look for the most influential activites that will create  the most results. Don't waste time on doing trival things. Focus on areas which can make a real difference in your life and career. Blur out low-value activities.

## Consider the consequences
Be a long-term thinker. Don't seek immediate gratification

> “Losers try to escape from their fears and drudgery with activities that are tension-relieving. Winners are motivated by their desires toward activities that are goal-achieving.”

You need motive to be motivated. THe more motivated you are, the more driven you will be to get your work done. Ask these three questions:
- What are my highest value activities?
- What can I and only I do that will make a real difference?
- What is the most valuable use of time right now?/ What is my biggest frog right now.

## Practice creative procrastination
Practice procrastination on purpose. Put off the small and the less ugly frogs before you eat the ugliest frogs. 

## Say "No" more often
No is a powerful word that you need to add to your vocabulary. Say no more often when things come your way. Say it politely. Say it clearly so that there are no misunderstandings. Say no to things that are not absolutely vital to you at the moment. 

## Think in ABCDE
Write down your tasks and assign a letter after them ABCDE
- A= Tasks that you must do
- B= Tasks that you should do
- C= Tasks that have no consequences at all, whether you do it or not
- D= Tasks that you can delegate to someone else
- E= Tasks that you can eliminate

Review your task list and assign each letter. This will help you sort out your priorities and work on what matters the most

## The law of three
- One thing all day long
	-  ‘If you could do only one thing on this list all day long, which one task would contribute the greatest value to your company?’
- Transform your life with these questions
	- What are the three most important business or career goals right now?
	- What are your three most important family or relationship goals right now?
	- What are your three biggest problems or concerns in life right now/

The purpose of time management is to get more things done in less time so that you can spend more time with people you care about and doing things that generate the greatest amount of joy in your life.

## Prepare throughly before you begin
Have everything you need before you begin so that you don't have to waste time searching for things once you begin your work. Remove distractions from your work place. Organize your work area and create a comfortable workspace. 

## Take one step at a time
A great life or greate career is built by performing one task at a time. You overcome procrastination by taking the first step, and then taking it one more step at a time. 

## Upgrade your skills
Your skills seperate yourself from others. Learn what you need to learn so that you can do your work at best. Never stop learning. Skills help you to be more productive and more effective. Moreover, they can help you to be more motivated. 

Take courses or read books in your field at least one hour every day. The more you know, the more motivated you will feel.

## Identify the key constraints
The suns rays don't burn until brought to focus. Clearly identify the limiting factors. Take action and get started. Starting your day with the removal of constraints fills you with energy and personal power. 

## Create Imaginary Deadlines
Work as if you had only one day to get your most important jobs done. Put pressure on yourself at high levels. Create your own forcing system. Set deadlines. Stick to it and try to beat your deadline. Race against the clock. Make it a game and win it. 

## Unplug from technology
Turn off your computer and your smartphone for one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. You will be amazed at what happens: nothing.  Resolve to unplug from technology for one full day each week. By the end of your digital detox, your mind will be calm and clear. When your mental batteries.

## Make technology your servent
The purpose of technology is to simplify your life not to increase complexity, and confusion. Clear your digital workspace as you would do with your physical workspace. Cose every program that is not needed for the task at hand. Block websites. 

Use your calendar. Refuse to let it use you. Avoid social media. Even if you use, make it work for you instead of being enslaved by it. 

## Focus your attention
Wherever your attention goes, your life follows. Don't multi-task. Multi-tasking is an illusion. You don't multi-task. You do task-shifting. Research shows that after an internet interruption, it takes abuot seventeen minutes for you to shift your total attention back to your task and continue working.

Instead of being distracted by interruptions, work in blocks without interruptions. Then give yourself little breaks. And repeat the same.

## Create large chunks of time
Most important tasks require a large blocks of time. Break your day by hour, and minutes and organize it in adcance. Use your calendar for time blocking and make every minute count. 

## Develop a sense of urgency
Do not wait; the time will never be “just right.” Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along. 

Take time to think, plan and set priorities but not to take action. Once you have a plan, quickly fire for action. 

## Single handle every task
Every great achievement of humankind has been preceded by a long period of hard, concentrated work until the job was done. Your ability to select your most important task, to begin it, and then to concentrate on it single-mindedly until it is complete is the key to high levels of performance and personal productivity.

The more disciplined you are on doing a single task, the more progress you will see and the better the quality of your work. 

> The world is full of people who are waiting for someone to come along and motivate them to be the kind of people they wish they could be. The problem is that no one is coming to the rescue.

-   These people are waiting for a bus on a street where no buses pass. If they don’t take charge of their lives and put the pressure on themselves, they can end up waiting forever. And that is what most people do.

-   Only about 2 percent of people can work entirely without supervision. We call these people “leaders.” This is the kind of person you are meant to be and that you can be, if you decide to be.

-   I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high school
    
-   what you want to do with your life.
    
-   They want to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to get you talking.
    
-   *You don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work*. *What you need to do is discover what you like*. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.
    
-   *Being a doctor is not the way it's portrayed on TV.*
    
-   *there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is doing them yet.*
    
-   The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world *it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.*
    
-   The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don't give up.
    
-   What they really mean is, don't get demoralized.
    
-   Don't think that you can't do what other people can.
    
-   In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.
    
-   If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason *we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy*.
    
-   t's not our fault if we can't do something as good.
    
-   'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. *But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.*
    
-   There is some variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist.
    
-   If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try.
    
-   don't underestimate your abilities
    
-   think the solution is to work in the other direction. *Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.* This is what most successful people actually do anyway.
    
-   *you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there?*
    
-   you *don't commit to anything in the future*, but just *look at the options available now*, and *choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.*
    
-   *It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time.* *Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.*
    
-   *Look for smart people and hard problem*s. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it.
    
-   they're deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they're saying something important.
    
-   Suspecting that the papers published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary theory journal, which published it.
    
-   *the best protection is always to be working on hard problems.*
    
-   Hard means worry: *if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.*
    
> -   Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't.
    
-   It's exhilarating to overcome worries.
    
-   You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.
    
-   *Ambition*
    
-   If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It's that *adults take responsibility for themselves.* Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.
    
-   *If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day job.*
    
-   And *when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.*
    
-   When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time.
    
-   *I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends* — that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. *Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal.*
    
-   Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not hard.
    
-   What I mean by *getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life.*
    
-   Corruption
    
-   *the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience*
    
-   Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just keep playing.
    
    Yes, as you suspect, *a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is crap.*
    
    the college admissions process is largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional. [7] So just keep playing.
    
    *Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience.*
    
    *Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to.*
    
    Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.
    
    *Curiosity*
    
    *what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, your first task is to figure that out.* *What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in*
    
    A better name would be curiosity.
    

-   *In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely.*
    
-   But *in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep.*
    
-   *Curiosity turns work into play.*
    
-   For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.
    
-   *most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline.*
    
-   They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in.
    
-   I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running
    
-   they know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.
    
-   *Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.*
    
-   If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question.
    
-   only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly.
    
-   *find a way to make it interesting*. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting.
    
-   people who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious.
    
-   Now
    
-   *f it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one.*
    
-   *Great questions don't appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head.*
    
-   the way to find great questions is not to search for them — not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd have made it.
    
-   The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to p*ut in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost.*
    
-   Put in time how and on what? *Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question*
    
-   *Choose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish*. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first
    
-   *If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another.*
    
-   *Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes.*
    
-   *secrecy also has its advantages*.
    
-   There's something pleasing about a secret project. And *you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail.*
    
-   *Paths can bend a lot more than you think.*
    
-   let the path grow out the project. *The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you learn.*
    
-   Don't disregard unseemly motivations. *One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something.*
    
-   Another *powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to.*
    
-   what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers.
    
-   Now I have enough experience to realize that those *famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame*
    
-   I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool, and just done something I liked.
    
-   Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.
    
-   *Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity.*
    
-   In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult.
    
-   *You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age*.
    
-   you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long.
    
-   The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that *adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't.* That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So *get to work*. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.

# Start Here
A critical thing you need for success:

If you don't have a compelling why for your what, you'll eventually be frustrated and quit. Purpose gives you power. It creates a drive. Everything is figureoutable. 
- The outcome
	- Be more mindful of time and spend my time in activities of creating something instead of consuming and chasing cheap dopamine.
## Guideline #1: Retrain your learning model
Destroy the destructive thoughts. Two thoughts
- **I know this already**. Switch it to a growth mindset. Ask question, be curious. 
- **This won't work for me** Change that statement to growth mindset question. How will it work for you?
Asking questions opens you to multiple opportunities.

## Guideline #2: Be a curious, creative scientist
Be curious about your own psychology and behaviours. Use the data to improve your own time

## Guideline #3: Self-compassion & Self-celeberation
Don't be hard on yourself. Make changes to your mindset and behaviors. Focus on progress not perfection. 

## Guideline #4: Honor everyone's messy beautiful one of a kind life
Not everyone is living on the same page as you. 

## Guideline #5: Absorb it all and use one tool to start with
Trying to change too many things at once is a recipe for failure and overwhelm. Give yourself time.

| Time Stress                                                                    | Time Genius                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Thinking and behaving like 99%. On our phone. Constantly busy. Exhausted       | Brave enough to not follow the herd. Reject the                                     |
| 10 hours+ time of day on screens. Average person will spend 44 years on screen | Your phone plays minor role. Everything disabled. Rarely interrupted and distracted |
| Chronic stress. Too tired to function at work                                  | You use technoly only as servent. You priortize.                                    |
|                                                                                | Wake up every single day knowing what you have to do                                |
At any given moment, you have the power to choose which world you want to live in.

> "The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it." - Henry David Thoreau

### Time stress
- You believe **There's just never enough time**
- You hope to find time but rarely do anything
- You subconsciously use the victim language.
- No idea about what's important in work or life. Constantly chasing new shiny objects. Doing surface level busy work. Working every hour but not getting any significant thing done.
### Time Genius
- **There's always enough time for what matters most**
- You schedule and execute your practices first. Hope is not a strategy
- You use empowered language. You get to . You will. 
- Airplane mode. Don't disturb mode. Work with short, focused bursts and priortize, joy, play and rest
- You know what's important. So you intentionally ignore what's not. You set prioritizes and review them periodically

Time is an emotional experience. Take control of your time story, your mindset and beliefs. 

### Time genius truth
> What often matters more than the activity we're doing at any given moment is how we feel about it. 


## The Art  & Science of Changing Time Beliefs
- What you say inside your head wires your brain for either success or failure.
- Our brains are malleable and programmable
- The answer to changing your beliefs is repetition: Thinking, acting and behaviours
- Mind and body are unified system. Your body affects your mind and your mind affects your body.
- Use your conscious mind to change your subconscious and use your subconscious to change your conscious actions.
- Practice makes permanenet
- I'm not someone who does this
- Change your **I can't** to **I don't**
	- I don't do procrastination
	- I don't wake up with my phone by side
	- I don't waste time on silly things
- What you say to your mind creates results
-  Marie's Mantras
	- Everything I say Yes to means saying No to something else
	- My commitments are stronger than my moods
	- If it's not scheduled, its not real
	- I create before I consume
	- There's always time for what's most important
- Knowing something doesn't change your life, doing something does.

## There's Always Time For What's Most Important
- There's never enough time is time scarcity
- We tend to overestimate the time we work by 10%
- We underestimate how much time we sleep and leisure time we have
- Small time blocks add to a large amount of time
- 20-30 minutes a day is enough to change your different parts of your life.
- **Design your ideal time blocks for the week**
- 8 hrs sleep, 8 hrs work. Now prioritize and schedule what you want to do in the remaining 8 hours
- That will determine where your life is headed
- You are your most important asset in this world
- Everybody wins when you prioritize your own self-care

## The Power of Owning Your Choices
- Nobody is forcing you to do something. If so, stop complaining. You are causing unncessarys sufferings.
- Own your decisions and choices
- Awareness
- Attitude Adjustment
- Take Action
- Thoughts---Feelings---Behaviors---Quality of Life

Google Director Of Engineering: This is how fast the world will change in ten years | by Michael Simmons | Accelerated Intelligence | Medium

-   Futurists from the 20th century predicted that labor saving devices would make leisure abundant.
    
-   “For the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem — *how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares,* *how to occupy the leisure*, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”
    
-   Things didn’t quite go as expected.
    
-   “Rather than being bored to death, *our actual challenge is to avoid anxiety attacks, psychotic breakdowns, heart attacks, and strokes resulting from being accelerated to death*.”
-   Rather than inhabiting a world of time wealth, *we’re inhabiting a world of time poverty.* Rather than feeling the luxury of time freedom, we’re feeling the burden of constant hurry.
    
-   *Time Is Accelerating Because Of The Red Queen Effect*
    
-   life on earth must compete to stay alive
    
-   *Predators and prey are in a never-ending race to evolve new abilities to avoid extinction*
    
-   *Rabbits that evolve longer ears to hear foxes survive more. Foxes that develop stronger legs to run faster catch more rabbits and don’t starve*. And so on.
    
-   *If a competitor makes an improvement, you must make an equal or greater improvement just to stay neck-and-neck with them*. *Stay the same and you fall behind.*
    
> -   “Standing still is the fastest way of moving backwards in a rapidly changing world.”
    
-   evolution is a double-edged sword. On one hand, *innovations increase survival*. *On the other hand, they also increase competition, which reduces survival.*
    
-   With humans, we see a shift from *competing based on biology to competing based on ideas* (cultures, strategies, technologies, etc.).
    
-   Companies compete for top talent. Employees compete for open positions.
    
-   Employees compete to move up the corporate ladder.
    
-   Companies compete for investors. Investors compete for the best startups.
    
-   Companies compete against each other via their products and services.
    
-   Scientists compete against each other for publication, citation, awards, and funding.
    
-   [Everyone competes for attention](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/understand-these-8-truths-and-our-crazy-world-will-suddenly-make-sense-to-you-9b061ad9694).
    
-   *when many are already feeling overwhelmed by change, things are about to take off even faster*
    
-   20 years from now, the rate of change will be 4x what it is now. Things will keep accelerating from there, and in 40 years, it will be 16x (more on these numbers later).
    
-   *The Coming Acceleration Shock*
    
> -   “If somebody describes the world of the mid-twenty-first century to you and it doesn’t sound like science fiction, it is certainly false. We cannot be sure of the specifics; change itself is the only certainty.”
    
-   — Yuval Noah Harari
    
-   “The future will be far more surprising than most people realize.”
    
-   *an exponential curve looks like a straight line when examined for only a brief duration.*
    
-   Introducing The 10-Year Rule
    
-   “My models show that we are doubling the paradigm-shift rate every decade.”
    
-   — Ray Kurzweil
    
-   “We won’t experience one hundred years of technological advance in the twenty-first century; we will witness on the order of twenty thousand years of progress (again, when measured by today’s rate of progress), or *about one thousand times greater than what was achieved in the twentieth century.”*
    
-   *because there is a trend in the past, it doesn’t mean it will [continue in the future](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-who-shape-future-ones-most-understand-present-michael-simmons/)*. But, the way I see it, if a trend has existed on Earth for a billion years, it’s worth at least planning for the possibility that it will happen in the next 20 years.

-   *How To Prepare For The Coming Acceleration Shock*
    
-   “When an industry is subjected to an important innovation, that industry typically feels a significant uptick in the overall clockspeed.”
    
-   the rapid evolution of human culture, ideas, strategies, and technology is a double-edged sword. On one hand, innovations increase efficiency. On the other hand, it also increases competition.
    
-   Race against people.
    
-   Race against machines. T
    
-   Race against the world.
    
-   *Rather than competing against the best in your local area, you’re competing against the best in the world.* In other words, rather than competing against a small number of people, you’re competing against 1,000x the number of people. The result of global competition is that competition is exponentially more fierce and winner-take-all.
    
-   *What does the extreme competition mean?*
    
-   On the positive side, this increasing competition creates incredible innovation. As consumers, we have people racing to serve needs we didn’t even realize we had faster, cheaper, and better.
    
-   On the negative side, as workers, we are the ones racing to serve customers. It feels like we’re on a treadmill and that if we get off that treadmill to smell the roses of life for too long, we may fall irreparably behind.
    
-   “One of the peculiar features of history is that time always erodes advantage. Every invention sooner or later leads to a counterinvention. Every success contains the seeds of its own overthrow. Every hegemony comes to an end. Evolutionary history is no different. *Progress and success are always relative… In history and in evolution, progress is always a futile*, Sisyphean struggle to stay in the same relative place by getting ever better at things.”
    
-   — Matt Ridley
    
-   We’re also seeing inequality skyrocket. One of the craziest statistics here is that the world’s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than 4.6 billion people combined, [according to Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/worlds-billionaires-have-more-wealth-46-billion-people). Even more surprising, the 26 richest people own as much as the poorest 50%. It’s astounding.
    
-   *Movies have faster cuts*. When my kids were younger, I took it as an opportunity to rewatch the first Star Wars. It was too slow to keep my attention.
    
-   More and more people are *fast forwarding media content*. Netflix recently added the ability to watch all of its shows at 1.5x speed. Even Audible recently increased its max speed from 3x to 3.5x.
    
-   Our *language is becoming shorter, more informal, and filled with acronyms*…
    
-   We’re seeing book summary websites get venture capital and now websites that offer [book summaries of book summaries](https://fourminutebooks.com/).
    
-   Not too long ago, Google Calendar added 15 minute increments. Will it soon copy Elon Musk’s [5-minute increments](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312193)?
    
-   Finally, we’ve all heard about increasing rates of anxiety. Many times social media usage and technology devices are scapegoated as the root cause. But maybe all of these are part of a deeper phenomenon… time acceleration.
    
-   *What We Can Do About Time Acceleration In Our Careers*
    
> -   “In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products but above all to reinvent yourself again and again.”
    
-   — Yuval Noah Harari
    
-   If you don’t prepare now, you will be progressively outcompeted and overwhelmed.
    
-   So the question becomes, how do you want to run the race?
    
-   Follow the pace of the crowd: In other words, do what most people are doing (i.e. get a 9–5 job and do what’s expected of you). This is the least stressful option in the short-term, but you risk falling behind in the long-term.
    
-   Work harder than others: This helps you progress in your career faster, but you sacrifice time with family & friends along with personal health… not to mention that you risk losing out to people who are learning more than you.
    
-   *Outlearn others and let your knowledge compound:* Learning is the ultimate productivity hack. In other words, *it provides the greatest leverage.* It’s the tool that the greatest innovators and business thinkers of our time (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and others) use to get ahead.
-   The 5-Hour Rule: The Antidote To The Exploding Pace Of Modern Life
    
-   “Read 500 pages every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.”
    
-   — Warren Buffett
    
-   The beauty of the 5-Hour Rule is that you don’t have to work yourself to death, you can have fun learning, and you don’t have to make huge personal sacrifices.
    
-   *When you set aside an hour in your day for deliberate learning, your productivity for the day may decrease, but your productivity over your life skyrockets as your knowledge compounds.*

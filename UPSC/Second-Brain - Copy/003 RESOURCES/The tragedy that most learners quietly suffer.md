-   Ambitious learners learn faster and better than others. T*hey diligently take notes.* *They also apply what they learned.* Yet..
    
-   They just aren’t recognized for the wealth of their knowledge, which means they get overlooked for promotions, job opportunities, or client projects — even if they have way more expertise than the winning competitor.
    
-   *Why ambitious learners are NOT being valued for what they’re worth*
    
-   While they might have deep expertise in a topic, ***they haven’t publicly shared what they learned.*** They have no proof to show others how they have mastered the topic. As a result, ***they have zero perceived credibility.***
    
-   When we have to hire an expert, we always look at their online content. *Are they able to show us that they know the topic better than others? If they don’t blow us away with their content, or if they haven’t shared their ideas online, we pass on them.*
    
-   “I mean, if we are gonna spend hundreds of dollars per hour to consult them, why should we take the risk? I can easily find an expert who has a body of great articles under their name”
    
-   ***To be valued for what you know, you need to publicly demonstrate your expertise.***
    
-   ***Share what you learn online***. The most successful learners get this…
    
-   Jack Butcher shared what he learned through tweets and attracted 400,000+ social media followers in 18 months.
    
-   Patricia Mou started her weekly email newsletter to curate and share the best self-improvement content, which now nets her a 5-figure side-income.
    
-   Brian Johnson shared what he learned about ancient philosophers, leading to a community of tens of thousands of paying members.
    
-   By sharing what I learned in articles, I went from having zero following and brand to building a Facebook group of 300,000+ members and getting tens of millions of views in top publications like Fortune, HBR, and Inc. Magazine.
    
-   All you need to do is put in the work every day for one month.

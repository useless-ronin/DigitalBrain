-   we all have idols and people who inspire us. But the problem with these questions is they train the mind to think the secret to becoming successful is to do what others before you have done.
    
-   **No legendary writer becomes legendary by trying to write like someone else.
    
-   The writers who become known in the world do not write like someone else before them.
    
-   Instead, *legendary writers become known for a niche they own.*
    
-   Your goal is not to pick another writer out in the world and then ask, “How can I do what they do, but better?” That’s a proven path to becoming Pepsi (the next-best alternative to Coke).
    
-   *your goal is to write something DIFFERENT*. *Something that hasn’t been written (or written in that way) yet.*
    
-   *Your goal is to become known for a niche you own.*
    
-   “Should I read this mystery writer or that mystery writer?” — and force the reader to make a choice: “Should I read horror mystery, or comedy mystery?”

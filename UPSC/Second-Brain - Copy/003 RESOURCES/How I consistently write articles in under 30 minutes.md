 If you’re someone who enjoys and/or makes an income through writing, I hope this trick helps you too.
    
-   *real-time edits are distracting.*
    
-   *Real-time edits take away from the free-flowing thought process — the creative and imaginative side of my brain — in favor of the sequencing side of my brain*. The side that wants things to be neat and orderly.
    
-   The constant mental switching leaves me with too much downtime in the process. 
    
-   really hard for me to get through an article from start to finish.
    
-   *what is writing?*
    
-   Ultimately, I look at it as *translating thoughts from my brain into text that can be read and understood by someone else.* For me, *it’s a transcription and thought transfer process.*
    
-   *physical typing is not the most efficient way to write.*
    
-   The Key to Efficiency: *Talk-to-Text*
    
-   I share my words and let technology transcribe them for me.
    
-   But talk-to-text isn’t perfect. It makes context errors (or I make speaking errors) and what ends up typed out may not be exactly what I had intende
    
-   I can make minor corrections without interrupting my thought proces
    
-   The elephant in the room: i*s physical typing essential to being a writer?*
    
-   Initially, I thought physical typing might be essential to my identity as a writer.
    
-   I now consider *talk-to-text to be just another step in the direction of writing efficiency.*
    
-   we all know the artistic part of writing — the part that makes a piece feel cohesive, polished, well-organized — usually happens later in the editing process anyway.
    
-   *A way to get more ideas translated into text that can be read and understood by others. Just as these other innovations were.*

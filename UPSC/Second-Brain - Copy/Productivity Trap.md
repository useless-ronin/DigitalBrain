We are living in a world hyper-focused on productivity. Everybody is talking about being productive. To a point, its good, but being hyperfocused on productivity is not good either.

I fell in the productivity trap for a long time. I read countless blogs and articles, and dozens of books on productivity. When you are reading such things, it feels like you are being productive but you are not. Instead of doing the work, you are feeding yourself how to do the work effectively. You need to work, not read how to work.

One Quote:
> Your purpose is not to do things effectively. It's to do the important things. 

Big difference, right? Let productivity go to hell. Focus on doing things that are important to you. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you have to do it.
